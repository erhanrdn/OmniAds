# Step 11 — Accepted Baseline Freeze, Closure Audit, And Regression Guard

## 1. Executive Summary

* Step 11 was executed as a closure-and-hardening step, not a new proof step and not a new access step.
* actual repo/live truth was re-verified first on April 13, 2026.
* current repo `HEAD` and `origin/main` were both `efceb546e668668d4427d847400a7dd55ee54e1e`.
* live runtime stayed on accepted Step 10 product SHA `0dbd9cff0b1dc383e06537ebdc1068db76b9686a`.
* `release-authority` reported live `0dbd9cff0b1dc383e06537ebdc1068db76b9686a` and main `efceb546e668668d4427d847400a7dd55ee54e1e`.
* runtime/main were drifted on exact SHA, but that drift was explainable:
  * main only advanced to the Step 10 continuity/docs commit
  * no non-program commits landed after the Step 10 continuity state
* the accepted Step 10 understanding still held in substance:
  * live runtime still matched the accepted proof build
  * temporary proof access remained gone
  * no deploy or release-authority defect was proven
* Step 11 added durable regression guards around the accepted Meta and Creative operator baseline.
* a durable final closure artifact was added:
  * `docs/operator-rebuild/CLOSURE_AUDIT.md`
* continuity docs now explicitly mark operator-rebuild as closed and accepted.
* no temporary proof access was recreated.
* verdict:
  * `accepted`

## 2. Truth Re-Verification

Read order used before Step 11 work:

1. `docs/operator-rebuild/HANDOFF.md`
2. `docs/operator-rebuild-staging/LATEST_REPORT.md`
3. `docs/operator-rebuild-staging/STATUS.md`

Verified current truth on April 13, 2026:

* current branch
  * `main`
* current actual repo `HEAD`
  * `efceb546e668668d4427d847400a7dd55ee54e1e`
* current actual `origin/main`
  * `efceb546e668668d4427d847400a7dd55ee54e1e`
* `https://adsecute.com/api/build-info`
  * `buildId` `0dbd9cff0b1dc383e06537ebdc1068db76b9686a`
* `https://adsecute.com/api/release-authority`
  * `currentLiveSha` `0dbd9cff0b1dc383e06537ebdc1068db76b9686a`
  * `currentMainSha` `efceb546e668668d4427d847400a7dd55ee54e1e`
  * `liveVsMain.status` `drifted`
  * `overall.status` `drifted`

Classification:

* current actual repo `HEAD`
  * `efceb546e668668d4427d847400a7dd55ee54e1e`
* current actual `origin/main`
  * `efceb546e668668d4427d847400a7dd55ee54e1e`
* current live runtime SHA
  * `0dbd9cff0b1dc383e06537ebdc1068db76b9686a`
* current release-authority live SHA
  * `0dbd9cff0b1dc383e06537ebdc1068db76b9686a`
* current release-authority main SHA
  * `efceb546e668668d4427d847400a7dd55ee54e1e`
* runtime/main aligned or drifted
  * drifted on exact SHA
  * explainable because repo main only advanced to the Step 10 continuity/docs commit
* non-program commits after the Step 10 continuity state
  * none
* whether the accepted Step 10 understanding still holds
  * yes, in substance

Commit classification after the Step 10 live runtime SHA:

* `efceb54 step10: record temporary proof path, live proof, and teardown`
* interpretation:
  * program continuity/docs commit only
  * not a new product commit
  * not a reason to reopen accepted Step 10 proof or product debates

## 3. Closure Artifact

Added:

* `docs/operator-rebuild/CLOSURE_AUDIT.md`

That artifact now records:

* what the rebuild changed
* what was accepted
* what proof established acceptance
* what temporary proof path Step 10 used
* confirmation that the temporary proof path was removed
* what remains outside the rebuild program
* what future work must not reopen by default

## 4. Regression Guards Added Or Tightened

### 4.1 Meta

* `components/meta/meta-campaign-list.test.tsx`
  * added operator-first ordering coverage so action-first rows stay ahead of needs-truth, blocked, and watch rows
* `playwright/tests/reviewer-smoke.spec.ts`
  * added selected-campaign URL reachability coverage
  * made details opening idempotent
  * hardened scroll handling around campaign reasoning and ad-set action surfaces

### 4.2 Creative

* `components/creatives/CreativeDetailExperience.test.tsx`
  * added preview-ready support-only AI framing coverage
* `components/creatives/CreativeDecisionOsOverview.test.tsx`
  * tightened preview-truth wording and lane vocabulary coverage
* `components/creatives/CreativeDecisionOsDrawer.test.tsx`
  * added drawer support-framing coverage
* `playwright/tests/reviewer-smoke.spec.ts`
  * tightened preview-truth contract wording checks
  * tightened drawer support framing checks
  * tightened deterministic-decision and support-only AI checks

### 4.3 Commercial Truth Intersection

* `playwright/tests/commercial-truth-smoke.spec.ts`
  * aligned the accepted Creative trigger label to `Decision support`
  * replaced stale Creative selector assumptions with accepted selectors
  * aligned drawer assertions to accepted support framing
  * stabilized Meta campaign reasoning checks
  * fixed strict heading selection on the Commercial Truth page

## 5. No Proof Access Recreated

Step 11 did not recreate:

* temporary admin users
* temporary sessions
* temporary memberships
* user-level plan overrides
* temp auth storage files

Step 10 teardown remains the authoritative proof-path closure event.

## 6. Accepted Baseline

What is now considered frozen baseline truth:

* Meta operator-first hierarchy from Step 5
* Creative preview-truth and decision-first behavior from Step 6
* live deploy and verification posture from Step 7
* reviewer smoke stability from Steps 8 and 9
* non-demo proof success plus teardown semantics from Step 10

Commercial Truth relocation remains compatible with the accepted baseline, but it is outside the operator-rebuild step chain itself.

## 7. Verification

Truth/API verification:

* `git branch --show-current`
* `git rev-parse HEAD`
* `git ls-remote origin refs/heads/main`
* `curl -sS https://adsecute.com/api/build-info`
* `curl -sS https://adsecute.com/api/release-authority`

Build and typecheck:

* `npm run build`
  * passed
* `npx tsc --noEmit`
  * passed after the build regenerated `.next/types`

Targeted tests:

* `npx vitest run 'app/(dashboard)/platforms/meta/page.test.tsx' 'components/meta/meta-campaign-list.test.tsx' 'components/creatives/CreativeDetailExperience.test.tsx' 'components/creatives/CreativeDecisionOsOverview.test.tsx' 'components/creatives/CreativeDecisionOsDrawer.test.tsx'`
  * passed
* `PLAYWRIGHT_USE_WEBSERVER=0 PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=https://adsecute.com npx playwright test playwright/tests/reviewer-smoke.spec.ts`
  * passed
* `PLAYWRIGHT_USE_WEBSERVER=0 PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=https://adsecute.com npx playwright test playwright/tests/commercial-truth-smoke.spec.ts`
  * passed
  * execution canary case skipped because its explicit environment gate was not configured

## 8. Future Work Outside This Program

Outside operator-rebuild by default:

* Step 12
* new product feature work
* new proof-session creation
* auth redesign
* release-authority redesign without a real defect
* deploy work unless a real regression requires it
* permanent benchmark-business access work
* reopening the Step 10 temporary proof path just to repeat evidence

## 9. Final Verdict

`accepted`

Reason:

* accepted baseline re-verified against current repo/live truth
* durable closure artifact exists
* continuity docs now mark the program closed and accepted
* reviewer smoke remains healthy
* accepted Meta and Creative operator behavior now has meaningfully tighter regression guards
* no temporary proof access was recreated
