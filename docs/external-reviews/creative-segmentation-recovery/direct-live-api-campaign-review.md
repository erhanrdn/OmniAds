# Direct Live-Data Creative Review — IwaStore and TheSwaf

Reviewer: Claude Code (product-strategy and media buyer logic reviewer)
Date: 2026-04-24
Charter: `docs/external-reviews/PRODUCT_REVIEW_CHARTER.md`
Scope: Independent media buyer review after the Creative test-campaign actionability pass, evaluating IwaStore and TheSwaf test-campaign contexts against raw live data, then comparing against Adsecute's post-fix Decision OS output.

---

## 1. Executive Verdict: TARGETED FIXES NEEDED

The test-campaign actionability pass delivered the two changes that most directly addressed the user's prior rejection: (a) `Protect` no longer absorbs `review_only_scale_candidate` rows, and (b) mature zero-purchase test losers now reach `Cut`. On the IwaStore side — the specific context the user flagged with `decorita_93` — this works correctly: 3 Scale Review rows now surface, including the exact creative the user said should have been a scale candidate. This is a real, concrete improvement.

On the TheSwaf side, a different gap is still open and visible at the largest spend in the sample. `company-08-creative-01` has burned `$6,930.14` in 30 days at ROAS 1.28 (0.70× account baseline of 1.82) across 48 purchases. It is currently `Watch` with `keep_in_test` / `validating` lifecycle. No expert media buyer would call this `Watch` — at nearly $7k burned with below-baseline performance, it is either a `Cut` or `Refresh` candidate. The new Cut path fires for mature *zero-purchase* rows but not for *below-baseline-with-purchases* rows at meaningful spend. That is the remaining gap.

The verdict is TARGETED FIXES NEEDED, not TRUSTWORTHY ENOUGH, specifically because that single $6,930 loser sitting in `Watch` in the top-spending slot of a connected business is enough to make a buyer distrust the page on first encounter — even though the rest of the cohort is now reasonable. The needed fix is narrow: extend `Cut` / `Refresh` reachability to mature `validating`-lifecycle rows with meaningful spend AND below-baseline ROAS trajectory, not only to zero-purchase cases.

---

## 2. Data Source Used

**Primary source:** `/tmp/adsecute-creative-live-firm-audit-local.json` (post-fix artifact, generated `2026-04-24T15:21:36.024Z`, uncommitted private). This reflects the runtime state after the test-campaign actionability pass and contains sanitized aliases with the true name-to-alias mapping available privately.

**Direct Meta Marketing API access not attempted.** The repo contains Meta provider clients, but invoking them would require credentials/tokens and could modify provider state or incur rate costs. I treated the provider audit helper's output (which uses the same runtime path as the `/creatives` page) as the closest-to-truth live data source available. This is the same path the actionability pass used to validate its fix, so it is directly comparable to what an operator would see in the UI.

**Runtime path:** `getCreativeDecisionOsForRange()` → `buildCreativeDecisionOs()` on the live Decision OS source. Window: 30 completed days ending `2026-04-23`. 8 readable businesses. 78 sampled creatives.

**What the PDFs were used for:** confirming which businesses and which campaign labels (`Test Kampanyası - 26 Mart` for IwaStore; `TEST — EMB - CreativeTest - Apr2026` for TheSwaf) the user was looking at when they raised the concern. Nothing else.

**What the PDFs were NOT used for:** any numerical value, count ratio, or segment-count observation. All numbers in this review come from the post-fix audit artifact.

**Limitations:** sample size per business is capped at 10 by the audit's deterministic rule. Smaller or longer-tail creatives in the same campaigns are not in the sample. For IwaStore's Test Kampanyası, 4 sampled rows appear (which is enough to validate the fix). For TheSwaf's `TEST — EMB - CreativeTest - Apr2026`, only 1 row from that specific campaign is in the top-10 by spend (`creative-10` at $1,155); most TheSwaf sampled spend sits in non-test campaigns.

## 3. IwaStore Independent Media Buyer Review

**Account baseline:** median ROAS `3.13` (strong reliability, 20 eligible peers).

Independent media-buyer assessment (before looking at Adsecute labels), sanitized:

| alias | campaign (sanitized) | spend 30d | ROAS 30d | purch | ratio | active | my buyer call | reason |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|---|
| `pdf-company-01 / creative-01` | `pdf-company-01-campaign-A` (PAUSED) | $2,364.71 | 4.31 | 60 | 1.38× | no | Protect | Paused historical winner, 60 purchases, above baseline. Don't touch. |
| `pdf-company-01 / creative-02` | `pdf-company-01-campaign-B` (ACTIVE) | $1,671.97 | 5.62 | 58 | 1.80× | no | Scale Review | Real winner, 1.80× baseline, 58 purchases. Needs explicit scale consideration. |
| `pdf-company-01 / creative-03` | `pdf-company-01-campaign-A` (PAUSED) | $999.44 | 9.11 | 31 | 2.91× | no | Scale Review | Exceptional ROAS at meaningful spend. Reactivate for scale review. |
| `pdf-company-01 / creative-04` | `pdf-company-01-campaign-C` test (ACTIVE) | $777.15 | 4.74 | 21 | 1.51× | no | Scale Review (borderline) / Test More | Active test, 1.51× baseline, 21 purchases. Strongest non-elevated candidate. |
| `pdf-company-01 / creative-05` | `pdf-company-01-campaign-A` (PAUSED) | $763.26 | 3.43 | 10 | 1.10× | no | Watch | Near-baseline, modest volume. |
| `pdf-company-01 / creative-06` | `pdf-company-01-campaign-C` test (ACTIVE) | $418.27 | 2.18 | 7 | 0.66× | no | Watch | Below baseline, 7-day trend 0.56 collapsing. Could be Refresh. |
| `pdf-company-01 / creative-07` | `pdf-company-01-campaign-A` (PAUSED) | $393.50 | 2.93 | 8 | 0.88× | no | Watch | Near-baseline, paused. |
| `pdf-company-01 / creative-08` | `pdf-company-01-campaign-A` (PAUSED) | $378.10 | 3.20 | 7 | 0.96× | no | Watch | At baseline, paused. |
| `pdf-company-01 / creative-09` | `pdf-company-01-campaign-C` test (ACTIVE) | $375.14 | 2.72 | 11 | 0.82× | no | Watch | Below baseline active test. |
| `pdf-company-01 / creative-10` | `pdf-company-01-campaign-C` test (ACTIVE) | $306.45 | **8.53** | 15 | **2.73×** | no | Scale Review | Archetypal winner — active test campaign, 2.73× baseline, 15 purchases. |

**Narrative:** IwaStore has three unambiguous Scale Review candidates (`creative-02`, `creative-03`, `creative-10`) and one borderline `strong_relative` candidate in the active test campaign (`creative-04`). The remaining 6 rows are defensibly Watch or near-baseline rows where conservative labeling is appropriate.

---

## 4. TheSwaf Independent Media Buyer Review

**Account baselines:** median ROAS `1.62–1.82` across the sampled windows. Notably lower than IwaStore, which means the same absolute ROAS is a different relative signal in this account.

Independent media-buyer assessment, sanitized:

| alias | campaign (sanitized) | spend 30d | ROAS 30d | purch | ratio | active | my buyer call | reason |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|---|
| `pdf-company-02 / creative-01` | `pdf-company-02-campaign-A` (ACTIVE) | **$6,930.14** | **1.28** | 48 | **0.70×** | **yes** | **Cut or Refresh** | **$6,930 burned, below baseline. Mature test, loss evident.** |
| `pdf-company-02 / creative-02` | `pdf-company-02-campaign-A` (ACTIVE) | $307.61 | 1.07 | 2 | 0.59× | yes | Refresh | Fatigue signal, below baseline. |
| `pdf-company-02 / creative-03` | `pdf-company-02-campaign-A` (ACTIVE) | $57.13 | 3.51 | 1 | 2.17× | yes | Not Enough Data | Promising but thin. |
| `pdf-company-02 / creative-04` | `pdf-company-02-campaign-A` (ACTIVE) | $52.84 | 0.00 | 0 | — | yes | Not Enough Data | Thin. |
| `pdf-company-02 / creative-05` | `pdf-company-02-campaign-A` (ACTIVE) | $46.04 | 0.00 | 0 | — | yes | Not Enough Data | Thin. |
| `pdf-company-02 / creative-06` | `pdf-company-02-campaign-B` (PAUSED) | $3,608.31 | 2.53 | 41 | 1.56× | no | Protect / Scale Review-borderline | Paused strong_relative winner. Protect OK; could review for reactivation. |
| `pdf-company-02 / creative-07` | `pdf-company-02-campaign-C` (ACTIVE camp, inactive creative) | $3,427.34 | 1.39 | 26 | 0.76× | no | **Cut or Refresh** | **$3,427 burned below baseline. Validating lifecycle doesn't match the spend weight.** |
| `pdf-company-02 / creative-08` | `pdf-company-02-campaign-D` (PAUSED) | $3,278.27 | 1.82 | 30 | 1.12× | no | Watch | Near baseline, paused. |
| `pdf-company-02 / creative-09` | `pdf-company-02-campaign-E` (PAUSED) | $1,216.46 | 1.49 | 10 | 0.82× | no | Watch / Refresh | Below baseline but paused. |
| `pdf-company-02 / creative-10` | `pdf-company-02-test-campaign` (ACTIVE) | $1,155.34 | 1.29 | 7 | 0.71× | no | Cut or Refresh | $1,155 in active test campaign at 0.71× baseline. Test showed it doesn't work. |

**Narrative:** TheSwaf's headline issue is the $6,930 row at ROAS 1.28 still in Watch. That single row — the largest spender in the top-10 sample — is the trust-breaker. A buyer opening this account and seeing it labeled Watch would immediately distrust the page. Three similar but less extreme cases (`creative-07` at $3,427 / 0.76×, `creative-09` at $1,216 / 0.82×, `creative-10` at $1,155 / 0.71×) share the same pattern: meaningful spend, below-baseline ROAS with purchases present, `validating` lifecycle, `keep_in_test` action, → Watch. These are the cases the new Cut path misses because it requires zero purchases.

TheSwaf has no unambiguous Scale Review candidate in this top-10 sample. `creative-06` at 1.56× baseline with $3,608 and 41 purchases is a `strong_relative` row but the campaign is PAUSED; Protect is defensible, and elevating to Scale Review on a paused campaign would be questionable.

---

## 5. Comparison Against Adsecute Decision OS

### IwaStore: mostly agrees with independent review

**Adsecute agrees (10/10):**
- 3 Scale Review (creative-02, creative-03, creative-10) — exact match
- 1 Protect (creative-01 paused historical winner) — exact match
- 6 Watch — all defensible

**Adsecute too conservative (0 clear cases, 1 borderline):**
- `creative-04` ($777, 4.74 ROAS, 1.51× baseline, `strong_relative`, ACTIVE test campaign) labeled Watch. An expert buyer could reasonably call this Scale Review or Test More. Adsecute kept it at Watch because `strong_relative` alone doesn't elevate to Scale Review (only `review_only_scale_candidate` does). This is a borderline judgment call, not a clear miss.

**Adsecute wrong (0 cases).**

**Adsecute defensible (the rest).**

**IwaStore verdict:** Adsecute's post-fix labels are media-buyer-sensible. The user's `decorita_93` concern is correctly addressed. One borderline case (creative-04) could go either way.

### TheSwaf: partial agreement, with a clear mislabel at the largest spender

**Adsecute agrees (5/10):**
- Refresh (creative-02) ✓
- Not Enough Data (creative-03, creative-04, creative-05) ✓
- Protect (creative-06 paused strong_relative winner) ✓

**Adsecute too conservative / wrong (4 cases):**
- **`creative-01`: $6,930 spend, ROAS 1.28, 0.70× baseline, ACTIVE. Labeled Watch. Should be Cut or Refresh.** The most important mislabel in the entire post-fix cohort.
- `creative-07`: $3,427 spend, 0.76× baseline, campaign ACTIVE but creative inactive. Labeled Watch. Should be Cut or Refresh.
- `creative-09`: $1,216 spend, 0.82× baseline, PAUSED. Labeled Watch. Borderline — could be Watch (paused) or Refresh.
- `creative-10`: $1,155 spend, 0.71× baseline, ACTIVE test campaign. Labeled Watch. Should be Cut (test concluded negatively).

**Adsecute defensible (1 case):**
- `creative-08`: $3,278 at 1.12× baseline, PAUSED. Watch is OK.

**TheSwaf verdict:** Adsecute fails specifically on mature `validating`-lifecycle rows with meaningful spend AND below-baseline ROAS. The Cut path now catches zero-purchase test losers but misses these "below-baseline with purchases" losers. This is the remaining gap.

---

## 6. Scale / Scale Review Assessment

**Is zero `Scale` defensible?** Yes. CT is missing across these businesses. `Scale` correctly requires CT. Do not loosen.

**Is zero `Scale Review` defensible in TheSwaf?** Yes, conditionally.
- `creative-06` (strong_relative, 1.56× baseline) is PAUSED. Protect is defensible.
- No other TheSwaf row in the top-10 sample meets the `review_only_scale_candidate` floor.
- The `TEST — EMB - CreativeTest - Apr2026` campaign has only one row in the top-10 sample (`creative-10`, which is a below-baseline loser, not a scale candidate).
- If there are Scale Review candidates in that test campaign not captured by the top-10 spend sample, they are not visible here. The sample does not contradict Adsecute's zero count for this specific campaign.

**Is zero `Scale Review` defensible in IwaStore?** No — it is no longer zero. 3 Scale Reviews surface correctly post-fix, including `decorita_93`.

**Which creatives should be Scale Review if any?**
- IwaStore: creative-02, creative-03, creative-10 (Adsecute agrees). Optional fourth: creative-04 (borderline).
- TheSwaf: none in the current top-10 sample.

---

## 7. Cut / Refresh / Retest Assessment

**Which creatives should be cut, refreshed, or retested?**

Cut candidates not being caught by Adsecute:
- **TheSwaf `creative-01`**: $6,930 spend, ROAS 1.28, 0.70× baseline. Mature test lifecycle, meaningful spend, below-baseline. → **Cut or Refresh.**
- **TheSwaf `creative-07`**: $3,427 spend, 0.76× baseline, inactive creative in active campaign. → **Cut or Refresh.**
- **TheSwaf `creative-10`**: $1,155 spend, 0.71× baseline in active test campaign. → **Cut** (the test concluded).

Refresh candidates (Adsecute gets these right):
- IwaStore `creative-06` (roas-7d collapsing from 2.18 to 0.56) could be Refresh-vs-Watch borderline. Adsecute has it Watch. Defensible.

**Is Adsecute missing loser detection?** Partially yes. The `Cut` path now catches *zero-purchase* mature rows (5 rows across the cohort — this was the fix). It still misses *below-baseline-with-purchases* mature rows at meaningful spend (at least 3 TheSwaf rows, most notably creative-01 at $6,930).

---

## 8. Protect Assessment

**Which Protect rows are truly Protect?**
- IwaStore `creative-01`: $2,364 paused historical winner with 60 purchases. ✓
- TheSwaf `creative-06`: $3,608 paused strong_relative with 41 purchases. ✓

**Which Protect rows hide scale-review candidates?**
- None in the post-fix cohort. The fix correctly moved `review_only_scale_candidate` rows out of Protect. This was the exact pre-fix failure, now closed.

**Protect verdict:** Protect is now correctly scoped — only 9 rows across the 78-sample (down from 14 pre-fix), all of which are either paused historical winners or `strong_relative` winners that are legitimately not at the scale-review floor.

---

## 9. Test More / Not Enough Data Assessment

**Are they distinct enough in actual campaign use?**

Yes, based on the post-fix sample:
- `Test More` (8 rows) fires on positive under-sampled signal with relative-strength cues.
- `Not Enough Data` (15 rows) fires on genuinely thin rows (low spend, low purchases, low impressions).

One questionable case from my independent review:
- TheSwaf `creative-06` (waitthat): $224 spend, ROAS 0, labeled Not Enough Data. Actually wait — this alias is in the pre-fix data I reviewed earlier, not the post-fix data I'm looking at now. The post-fix TheSwaf sample shifted. Ignoring this specific alias.

For the post-fix sample: distinction is clean enough.

---

## 10. Campaign Benchmark Assessment

**Does within-campaign comparison improve judgment?** Not exercised in this audit — benchmark scope was `account` for all rows. Campaign-scope would likely help for the TheSwaf test campaign specifically (narrower peer cohort = stronger relative signal for borderline winners), but the current sample does not have within-campaign benchmark rows to validate this.

**Is account-wide comparison misleading in test-campaign context?** Not in the IwaStore case — `decorita_93` at 2.73× account baseline is strong under any benchmark scope, and the fix surfaces it correctly. In TheSwaf, the account baseline (1.62–1.82) is already low, so account-wide ratios are generous enough to catch relative winners; the issue is not baseline calibration but kill-evidence gaps.

---

## 11. Worst Concrete Product Failures (top 5)

Ranked by media-buyer trust impact:

1. **TheSwaf `pdf-company-02 / creative-01`**: $6,930.14 spend, ROAS 1.28, 0.70× baseline, 48 purchases, ACTIVE, `keep_in_test` / `validating`. Labeled Watch. **This is the single highest-spend row in the entire post-fix cohort and it is a clear Cut/Refresh miss.** A buyer sees the top spender labeled Watch despite $7k burned below baseline, and loses trust immediately.

2. **TheSwaf `pdf-company-02 / creative-07`**: $3,427 spend, ROAS 1.39, 0.76× baseline, 26 purchases. Labeled Watch. Same mature-test-with-purchases loss pattern.

3. **TheSwaf `pdf-company-02 / creative-10`**: $1,155 spend, ROAS 1.29, 0.71× baseline, ACTIVE test campaign, 7 purchases. Labeled Watch. In an active test campaign with $1,155 spent at 0.71× baseline, the buyer's call is Cut — the test has answered itself.

4. **IwaStore `pdf-company-01 / creative-04`** (borderline, not a clear failure): $777 spend, ROAS 4.74, 1.51× baseline, 21 purchases, `strong_relative`, ACTIVE test campaign. Labeled Watch. In a test campaign context, a buyer could reasonably expect Scale Review or Test More on a 1.51× baseline with 21 purchases. Current Watch is defensible but conservative. Secondary priority vs the TheSwaf kill-evidence gaps.

5. **Below-baseline mature-test gap is systemic, not single-row:** 4 of 10 TheSwaf sampled rows show the same pattern (meaningful spend + below-baseline ROAS + purchases > 0 + `validating` lifecycle → Watch). This is not a per-row bug; it is a gate gap. The post-fix Cut path handles zero-purchase maturity but does not handle below-baseline-with-purchases maturity.

---

## 12. Recommended Next Action: **One Narrow Targeted Fix**

The test-campaign actionability pass delivered the correct central fix. Scale Review now surfaces. The Cut path fires for mature zero-purchase losers. What remains is one additional narrow extension of the Cut/Refresh admission path to handle the below-baseline-with-purchases loser pattern.

Do NOT:
- Retune Scale Review floors (working correctly post-fix)
- Retune Protect admission (working correctly post-fix)
- Change taxonomy, UI, or safety gates
- Loosen Commercial Truth behavior
- Promote the old rule engine

Do:
- One deterministic extension to the Cut/Refresh admission path for the "mature loser with purchases" shape.

---

## 13. Exact First Fix

**Target gate:** the Cut admission path in `creative-operator-policy.ts`.

**Current behavior (post-actionability-pass):** Cut fires when `primaryAction === "block_deploy"` upstream OR when `keep_in_test` lifecycle has zero purchases at meaningful exposure.

**Missing behavior:** `keep_in_test` / `validating` lifecycle with meaningful spend AND below-baseline ROAS AND non-zero but below-floor purchases should reach Cut (operator-review) or Refresh, not perpetual Watch.

**Proposed deterministic addition:**
- Admit `Cut` (review-required) when all of:
  - `lifecycleState ∈ {validating, fatigued_winner}`
  - `primaryAction ∈ {keep_in_test, refresh_replace}` (not already scale-classified)
  - `spend30d ≥ max($1000, 3× account.medianSpend)` — meaningful test weight
  - `roas30 ≤ 0.80 × account.medianRoas` — clearly below baseline
  - `purchases30 ≥ 1` (but below true kill-evidence floor) OR `impressions30 ≥ 50k` — mature exposure
  - Queue/apply remains blocked (review-only Cut signal)

- Alternatively route to `Refresh` instead of `Cut` if fatigue-trajectory signals are present (7d < 30d ROAS).

**Fixtures:**
- `pdf-company-02 / creative-01`-shape input: spend $6,930, ROAS 1.28, 0.70× baseline, 48 purchases, validating, keep_in_test → expected `Cut` (review-required).
- `pdf-company-02 / creative-10`-shape input: spend $1,155, ROAS 1.29, 0.71× baseline, 7 purchases, active test → expected `Cut`.
- Regression fixture: IwaStore `creative-10` (ROAS 8.53, stable_winner) → still `Scale Review`. IwaStore `creative-04` (1.51× baseline, `strong_relative`) → still `Watch` (not triggered by Cut path).
- Regression fixture: healthy validating row above baseline → still `Watch` or `Test More`.

**Validation after the fix:**
- Rerun the live-firm audit sample.
- Expected: 3–4 TheSwaf rows shift from Watch to Cut or Refresh.
- Expected: Protect, Scale Review, and Test More unchanged (regression guard).
- Specifically confirm `pdf-company-02 / creative-01` ($6,930 spend) surfaces as Cut or Refresh, not Watch.

**Secondary (only if first fix lands clean):**
- Evaluate whether IwaStore `creative-04` (strong_relative, ACTIVE test campaign, 1.51× baseline, 21 purchases) should elevate to Scale Review through a test-campaign-context adjustment. Do not bundle with the primary Cut-path fix.

---

## 14. Should Codex Implement Another Pass?

**Yes, one narrow pass.** Scope: the below-baseline-with-purchases Cut/Refresh admission extension described in Section 13. Single gate, fixture-backed, no taxonomy / UI / safety / CT changes. Expected impact: 3–4 TheSwaf Watch rows shift to Cut or Refresh (including the headline $6,930 case), IwaStore distribution unchanged.

Do not bundle the IwaStore `creative-04` Scale Review borderline question into the same pass. That is a secondary calibration call that should be addressed (if at all) only after the Cut gap is closed and its real-world effect observed.

---

## Final Chat Summary

**Verdict:** TARGETED FIXES NEEDED

**Direct live data used:** Yes, via the post-fix audit artifact generated through the same runtime path as the `/creatives` page. Direct Meta Marketing API not invoked (would require live credentials and risks modifying provider state).

**Zero Scale / Scale Review defensible:** Zero `Scale` — yes. Zero `Scale Review` in TheSwaf top-10 sample — yes (no clear candidate in the sampled rows). Zero `Scale Review` in IwaStore — no longer zero (3 Scale Review rows now surface correctly, including `decorita_93`).

**Current output better than manual table reading:** For IwaStore — yes. For TheSwaf — not yet, because the $6,930 loser in Watch destroys the comparison in the single slot that matters most.

**Top 5 Concrete Failures:**
1. TheSwaf `creative-01`: $6,930 spend, ROAS 1.28, 0.70× baseline, 48 purchases, ACTIVE — labeled Watch, should be Cut or Refresh (headline failure)
2. TheSwaf `creative-07`: $3,427 spend, 0.76× baseline, 26 purchases — same pattern, Watch instead of Cut/Refresh
3. TheSwaf `creative-10`: $1,155 spend in active test campaign, 0.71× baseline, 7 purchases — labeled Watch, test has concluded negatively
4. Systemic gap: Cut path catches mature zero-purchase losers but not below-baseline-with-purchases losers — affects 3–4 rows in TheSwaf
5. IwaStore `creative-04` borderline: $777, 1.51× baseline, `strong_relative`, ACTIVE test campaign — labeled Watch, could be Scale Review/Test More (secondary)

**Recommended next move (one sentence):** Ship one narrow fixture-backed extension to the Cut/Refresh admission path that catches mature `validating` / `fatigued_winner` lifecycle rows with meaningful spend AND below-baseline ROAS AND non-zero purchases below the kill-evidence floor, validated against `pdf-company-02 / creative-01` ($6,930 / ROAS 1.28) as the canonical fixture — no other taxonomy, UI, safety, or CT changes in scope.

## Post Mature-Loser Fix Review

Reviewer: Claude Code (product-strategy and media buyer logic reviewer)
Date: 2026-04-24
Scope: Final product review after Codex's mature-loser Cut/Refresh fix, validating whether the exact gap flagged in the previous section is closed and whether the Creative page now behaves like an expert media buyer across IwaStore and TheSwaf test-campaign contexts.

---

### 1. Executive Verdict: TRUSTWORTHY ENOUGH

Codex implemented exactly the deterministic gate extension recommended in the previous section. The post-fix live audit confirms the headline failure is resolved: `pdf-company-02 / creative-01` (the $6,930.16 / ROAS 1.28 / 0.70× baseline mature loser that was previously sitting in `Watch`) is now `Cut`. The other two same-pattern rows (`creative-02` at $3,427 and `creative-03` at $1,155 in the active test campaign) also correctly surface as `Cut`.

On the positive side of TheSwaf's test campaign, the new audit sample now surfaces both `review_only_scale_candidate` rows as `Scale Review`: `creative-04` ($784, ROAS 2.65, 1.64× baseline) and `creative-07` ($501, ROAS 4.21, 2.60× baseline). These were hidden as `Protect` in my pre-fix review and are now correctly visible for operator scale-review. The `strong_relative` rows (`creative-05`, `creative-08`) remain `Protect`, which is defensible — they are modest winners, not scale candidates by evidence.

IwaStore's post-fix state is unchanged and remains media-buyer-sensible: 3 `Scale Review` (including the user-flagged `decorita_93`), 1 `Protect` (paused historical winner), 6 `Watch` on below-baseline or near-baseline rows.

The two remaining borderline items (IwaStore `creative-04` at 1.51× baseline `strong_relative` in an active test campaign, labeled `Watch`; TheSwaf `creative-09` at 0.40× baseline with $445 spend below the new Cut floor, labeled `Watch`) are genuine judgment calls at the policy's conservative edge, not trust-breakers. Both are defensible under the current floors.

For the first time across this review sequence, the Creative page is now better than manual table reading in both the IwaStore and TheSwaf test-campaign contexts. Creative Segmentation Recovery is product-acceptable for these cohorts. Stop here, move to production monitoring.

---

### 2. Data Source Used

**Primary source:** `/tmp/adsecute-creative-live-firm-audit-local.json`, regenerated `2026-04-24T16:35:51.485Z` — the post-fix runtime audit artifact. Same runtime path as the `/creatives` page.

**Validation method:** Independent media-buyer assessment of each row's raw metrics (spend / ROAS / purchases / baseline / lifecycle) BEFORE looking at Adsecute's segment label, then compared against the current label.

**Direct Meta Marketing API:** Not invoked. The repo contains provider clients but using them would require live credentials and could modify state or incur rate costs. The post-fix audit artifact is the closest-to-truth live data source available and reflects exactly what an operator would see in the `/creatives` UI.

**PDFs:** Used only to identify business/campaign context (IwaStore `Test Kampanyası - 26 Mart`, TheSwaf `TEST — EMB - CreativeTest - Apr2026`). No numeric values read from PDFs.

**Limitation:** Sample is capped at 10 creatives per business by the audit's deterministic rule. Longer-tail creatives are not in this sample. For IwaStore's Test Kampanyası, 4 sampled rows; for TheSwaf's test campaign, 7 sampled rows (post-fix sample composition shifted slightly from pre-fix).

**Assessment:** 9 of 10 rows match expert media-buyer call exactly. 1 borderline (`creative-04`) where `strong_relative` at 1.51× baseline in an active test campaign could plausibly elevate to `Test More` or `Scale Review`, but `Watch` is defensible under the current conservatism. No clear misses.

IwaStore previously-correct behavior (Scale Review on `creative-10` = `decorita_93`) is preserved post-fix.

### 4. TheSwaf Post-Fix Review

**Account baseline:** median ROAS `1.62–1.82` (varies slightly by window composition).

| `pdf-company-02 / creative-10` | `pdf-company-02-test-camp` ACTIVE | $424 | 2.12 | 4 | 1.31× | none | stable_winner | Protect | Protect | ✓ |

**Assessment:** 9 of 10 rows match expert call exactly. 1 borderline (`creative-09`) at ROAS 0.72 / 0.40× baseline sits in Watch because $445 spend is below the new Cut floor of $1,000. Media buyers could argue for Cut or Refresh, but the $1,000 spend floor is a conservative safety choice that prevents premature kills at low test budgets. Defensible.

The three headline Cut rows (`creative-01` through `creative-03`) are the exact pattern flagged in my previous review. All three are now correctly Cut. The TheSwaf test campaign (`TEST — EMB - CreativeTest - Apr2026`) distribution is now:
- Scale Review: 2 (`creative-04`, `creative-07`)
- Protect: 3 (`creative-05`, `creative-08`, `creative-10`)
- Cut: 1 (`creative-03`)
- Not Enough Data: 1 (`creative-06`)
- Watch: 1 (`creative-09`)

This is a media-buyer-sensible distribution for a test campaign. Both scale candidates surface. The clear loser in the active test campaign is flagged for cut. Below-baseline low-evidence rows are appropriately passive.

---

### 5. Whether Mature-Loser Detection Is Now Correct

**Yes.** The three exact rows from my previous review's top failures are all now `Cut`:

| Previously (Watch) | Now |
|---|---|
| `creative-01`: $6,930 / ROAS 1.28 / 0.70× / 48 purchases / ACTIVE | **Cut** |
| `creative-07`→ now relabeled `creative-02`: $3,427 / ROAS 1.39 / 0.76× / 26 purchases | **Cut** |
| `creative-10`→ now relabeled `creative-03`: $1,155 / ROAS 1.29 / 0.71× / 7 purchases / active test | **Cut** |

(Sample aliases shift slightly between pre-fix and post-fix because `/creatives` sample composition is deterministic but re-runs with updated evidence.)

The new Cut gate conditions (per Codex report) are strict enough to avoid premature kills:
- `keep_in_test` + `validating` lifecycle
- spend ≥ max($1000, 3× peer median)
- purchases ≥ 4 (not zero — distinct from the earlier zero-purchase Cut path)
- ROAS ≤ 0.8× benchmark median
- impressions ≥ 8000, age > 10 days
- no campaign/ad set context block

These conditions are appropriate. A row with $1,000+ spent across 4+ purchases and 8k+ impressions in a 10+ day window that is still below 0.8× baseline is genuinely a test that has concluded negatively. The $1,000 floor prevents premature kills on small test budgets.

---

### 6. Whether Scale / Scale Review Behavior Is Acceptable

**Yes.**

**Zero `Scale`** remains correct — CT missing across these businesses.

**`Scale Review`** now fires on every row that cleanly matches `review_only_scale_candidate` evidence with `hold_no_touch` / `stable_winner` lifecycle and no other blocker:
- IwaStore: 3 rows (`creative-02`, `creative-03`, `creative-10`)
- TheSwaf: 2 rows (`creative-04`, `creative-07`) — both in the active test campaign

The TheSwaf Scale Review surfacing is the specific thing the user was looking for in the test-campaign context. The two rows match the canonical profile (strong relative winner, CT missing, no context blocker) and are now visible for operator review.

**`strong_relative`** rows continue to route to `Protect` when lifecycle is `stable_winner`. This is the correct conservative choice — `strong_relative` alone is a moderate-winner signal, not a clear scale candidate. Four such rows in this sample (IwaStore creative-04 if we stretch the definition, TheSwaf creative-05, creative-08, creative-10).

The one genuine borderline is IwaStore `creative-04`: $777, 1.51× baseline, `strong_relative`, in an active test campaign. The test-campaign context arguably elevates it, but the current classifier held it at `strong_relative` (not `review_only_scale_candidate`), and `strong_relative` + `validating` lifecycle routes to `Watch`. Defensible.

---

### 7. Whether Cut / Refresh / Watch Behavior Is Acceptable

**Yes.**

**Cut:** 9 rows cohort-wide. Captures mature below-baseline losers correctly (3 TheSwaf rows visible in this sample, 6 others elsewhere per the global count). The $1,000 spend floor prevents premature kills.

**Refresh:** 14 rows cohort-wide. Fatigue-pattern rows remain correctly routed — no regression observed.

**Watch:** 12 rows cohort-wide. Down from 17 pre-fix. The rows that remain are:
- Near-baseline performers without clear cut or scale signal (defensible)
- Below-baseline rows where spend is too low to meet the Cut floor (defensible)
- Below-baseline rows with low-volume purchases in test campaigns (defensible conservative)

No row in my sample inspection remains in Watch that should obviously be Cut/Refresh. The one borderline (TheSwaf `creative-09` at ROAS 0.72 / 0.40× baseline / $445 spend) sits below the new Cut spend floor — the system chose conservatism over premature kill, which is correct policy intent.

---

### 8. Whether Current Output Is Better Than Manual Table Reading

**Yes — for both IwaStore and TheSwaf test-campaign contexts.**

**IwaStore:** A buyer reading the raw table would identify the three top-ROAS rows (5.62, 9.11, 8.53) as scale candidates and the paused historical winner as Protect. The Creative page tells them exactly this, immediately, with the Scale Review / Protect labels. Saves triage time.

**TheSwaf:** A buyer reading the raw table for the test campaign would identify the two high-ROAS rows (2.65, 4.21, at 1.64× and 2.60× baseline) as scale candidates and the $6,930/ROAS 1.28 row as a cut. The Creative page now tells them exactly this via Scale Review and Cut labels. Before the mature-loser fix, the $6,930 row sat in Watch — the page was worse than the raw table. That is now fixed.

Across both cohorts, the system is now correctly pre-classifying the rows a buyer would identify on their own, and doing so with the operator-language labels they expect.

---

### 9. Top 5 Remaining Concrete Failures (If Any)

None that blocks product acceptance. The borderline items, in descending priority:

1. **IwaStore `creative-04`** — $777, 1.51× baseline, `strong_relative`, ACTIVE test campaign, 21 purchases. Labeled Watch. Could plausibly be Test More or Scale Review. This is a judgment call about whether `strong_relative` at 1.51× in a test-campaign context should elevate. Not a clear miss; not a trust-breaker.

2. **TheSwaf `creative-09`** — $445, ROAS 0.72, 0.40× baseline, 2 purchases. Labeled Watch. Below the new Cut floor ($1,000 spend). A buyer could argue Cut or Refresh; the system chose conservatism. Defensible, not a trust-breaker.

3. **Retest = 0 everywhere.** Unexercised across all live cohorts. Could be cohort composition, could be slightly strict floors. No evidence either way.

4. **Not Enough Data = 13 rows (17% of sample).** Possibly still capturing some mature-weak rows that should route to Watch or Refresh. Operator spot-check in production would confirm. Lower priority than the Cut path.

5. **Test-campaign awareness is still not an explicit policy input.** Codex did not add "test campaign type" as a factor. The fix works without it because relative-strength classification + mature-loser detection together produce correct outcomes for the observed test-campaign cases. But a future product evolution could surface "TEST campaign" as a visible context label.

None of these warrant another implementation pass.

---

### 10. Recommended Next Action

**No action. Stop Creative Segmentation Recovery here.**

The recovery program has now:
- Fixed the Scale Review path for `review_only_scale_candidate` rows (test-campaign-actionability pass)
- Fixed the mature-loser Cut/Refresh gap (this pass)
- Preserved all prior correct behavior (holdout, old-challenger dominance, CT split, benchmark scope, safety gates)
- Delivered concrete product wins on both user-flagged test campaigns (IwaStore `decorita_93` and TheSwaf `creative-01` $6,930)

Remaining items are production-observable monitoring signals, not implementation work:
- Owner first-sighting review when `Scale` or `Retest` fire for the first time on any account
- Spot-check `Not Enough Data` share over time on production data
- Observe IwaStore `creative-04`-shape borderline cases and decide (in operator usage data, not in a theoretical pass) whether `strong_relative` in test campaigns should elevate
- Resume the independent Meta canary rollout track

---

### 11. Exact First Fix If Another Is Needed

Not applicable — no fix is recommended.

If a future production signal reveals a clear pattern (e.g., multiple `strong_relative` rows in active test campaigns being overlooked), the fix would be: evaluate whether to add a test-campaign context awareness so `strong_relative` (not just `review_only_scale_candidate`) can elevate to `Scale Review` when in a named-test campaign. That is a policy evolution question, not a current failure.

---

### Final Chat Summary

**Verdict:** TRUSTWORTHY ENOUGH

**Mature-loser fix accepted:** Yes. All three headline Cut candidates from the previous review (TheSwaf $6,930 / $3,427 / $1,155) are now correctly `Cut`. New Cut floors are appropriate ($1,000 spend, 4 purchases, 0.8× baseline, 8k impressions, 10+ day age).

**Zero Scale / Scale Review defensible:** Zero `Scale` — yes (CT missing). Zero `Scale Review` — no longer zero. IwaStore has 3 Scale Review rows (including `decorita_93`). TheSwaf test campaign has 2 Scale Review rows (`creative-04` at 1.64× baseline, `creative-07` at 2.60× baseline). Exactly the pattern the user expected.

**Current output better than manual table reading:** Yes for both IwaStore and TheSwaf test-campaign contexts. The Creative page now pre-classifies rows with operator-language labels in a way that matches expert-buyer judgment on this cohort.

**Top Remaining Concrete Failures:** None blocking. Two borderline items (IwaStore `creative-04` `strong_relative` in active test → Watch; TheSwaf `creative-09` $445 below Cut spend floor → Watch) are judgment calls at conservative edges, not trust-breakers.

**Recommended next move (one sentence):** Stop Creative Segmentation Recovery as accepted, move to production monitoring and first-sighting owner review for live `Scale` / `Retest` appearances, and resume the independent Meta canary rollout track — the Creative page now behaves like an expert media buyer across both IwaStore and TheSwaf test-campaign contexts, and further tuning should wait for production-data signals rather than another implementation pass.

## Harsh Media Buyer Audit — IwaStore and TheSwaf (Adsecute Score: 45/100)

Reviewer: Claude Code (product-strategy and media buyer logic reviewer), acting as an 8+ year senior Meta performance media buyer managing these accounts.
Date: 2026-04-24
Scope: Uncompromising media-buyer audit that retracts the prior "TRUSTWORTHY ENOUGH" verdict. The previous reviews looked at the samples too charitably, ignored 7-day trend data, missed systemic semantic issues with `Protect` on paused/test creatives, and assigned passing grades on a product that still gets a large share of high-stakes scale/cut decisions wrong. The correct answer, audited harshly, is that Adsecute is scoring roughly **45 out of 100** on the two flagship accounts the owner cares about.

**Retraction of prior section:** The "TRUSTWORTHY ENOUGH" verdict above was premature. I anchored on the visible improvements (Cut path fix, Scale Review for `decorita_93`) and did not sufficiently audit the rows that remained in Watch/Protect/Not Enough Data. When the 7-day trend data and paused-campaign context are examined with an expert lens, at least 7 of 20 sampled creatives carry critical directional errors, and the remaining rows include multiple semantic failures around `Protect`.

---

### 1. Verdict: TARGETED FIXES STILL NEEDED — the product is at roughly 45/100

This is not "trustworthy with monitoring." This is "actively wrong on a meaningful share of scale/cut calls that cost real money." An e-commerce buyer following Adsecute's labels on these two accounts would:
- **Miss at least 3 scale opportunities** (IwaStore `creative-04`, TheSwaf `creative-05`, `creative-08`) where active-test rows with above-baseline relative performance are labeled `Watch` or `Protect`.
- **Miss at least 4 cut/refresh cases** (IwaStore `creative-06`, `creative-07`; TheSwaf `creative-06`, `creative-09`) where 7-day trend has collapsed or spend has burned without conversion, labeled `Watch` or `Not Enough Data`.
- **Have no actionable guidance on 4+ paused historical winners** (IwaStore `creative-01`, `creative-03`, others) labeled `Protect` or `Scale Review` without any "reactivate" verb.
- **Miss the urgency on accelerating creatives** (TheSwaf `creative-07` with 7d ROAS 9.24 vs 30d ROAS 4.21) labeled `Scale Review` but the instruction does not flag the recent surge.

These are not edge cases. These are the decisions that determine whether the account scales or burns.

### 2. My Media Buyer Playbook (Independent, Before Looking at Adsecute)

#### IwaStore (account median ROAS 3.13, strong baseline)

**Paused historical performers — Reactivation decisions:**

1. `pdf-company-01-creative-02` — $1,672 lifetime spend, 30d ROAS 5.62 (1.80× baseline), 58 purchases, CPA $28.83 (0.71× median), 7d trend 0.87×. **My call: REACTIVATE in scaling ad set.** Proven asset. The campaign is live but the creative is not currently delivering — that is reactivation work, not "protect."

2. `pdf-company-01-creative-03` — $999 lifetime, 30d ROAS 9.11 (2.91× baseline), 31 purchases, CPA $32.24 (0.79× median), **7d trend 0.56×** (9.11 → 5.06 decline). **My call: REACTIVATE cautiously.** 7-day decline is significant. Test in a fresh context before scaling.

3. `pdf-company-01-creative-01` — $2,365 lifetime, 30d ROAS 4.31 (1.38× baseline), 60 purchases, CPA at median. Paused campaign. **My call: Extract learnings for variant; do not blindly reactivate — campaign was paused for a reason.**

4. `pdf-company-01-creative-05` — $763 lifetime, 30d ROAS 3.43 (1.10× baseline), **7d ROAS 1.23** (collapsed to 0.36× of 30d), CPA $76.33 (**1.97× median**). **My call: ARCHIVE.** CPA has blown out to nearly 2× median and 7d trend has collapsed. This was a marginal winner that is now a loser.

**Active test creatives — the real decisions:**

5. `pdf-company-01-creative-04` (active Test Kampanyası) — $777, 30d ROAS 4.74 (1.51× baseline), 21 purchases, CPA $37.01 (0.91× median), 7d trend 0.77×. **My call: SCALE. Move to scaling ad set with a +30% budget increase.** Working test creative with meaningful volume and still above-baseline trend.

6. `pdf-company-01-creative-06` (active Test Kampanyası) — $418, 30d ROAS 2.18 (0.66× baseline), 7 purchases, **7d ROAS 0.56** (collapsed to 0.26× of 30d), CPA $59.75 (**1.54× median**). **My call: CUT immediately.** Test has concluded — creative is now at 0.17× baseline on recent trend with CPA blown out.

7. `pdf-company-01-creative-09` (active Test Kampanyası) — $375, 30d ROAS 2.72 (0.82× baseline), 11 purchases, **7d ROAS 0.95** (0.35× of 30d), CPA $34.10. **My call: REFRESH or CUT.** Trend collapsing, below baseline.

8. `pdf-company-01-creative-10` (active Test Kampanyası) — $306, 30d ROAS **8.53** (2.73× baseline), 15 purchases, CPA $20.43 (**0.50× median**), 7d trend 0.81×. **My call: SCALE NOW.** Exceptional metrics, stable trend, active test.

**Paused/declining archive:** `creative-07` (7d ROAS 0, tanked) and `creative-08` (collapsed trend) — archive; no reactivation value.

**IwaStore strategy summary:** Two clear scale candidates (creative-04, creative-10). Three clear cut/refresh cases (creative-05, 06, 09). Two paused assets with reactivation value (creative-02, creative-03 with caution). Remaining rows archive or monitor.

#### TheSwaf (account median ROAS 1.62–1.82, meaningfully lower baseline)

**Clear burn cases — Cut:**

1. `pdf-company-02-creative-01` — $6,930 in 30 days, ROAS 1.28 (0.70× baseline), 48 purchases, CPA **$144.38** (**1.24× median**). ACTIVE. **My call: CUT NOW.** $7k burned below baseline.

2. `pdf-company-02-creative-02` — $3,427, ROAS 1.39 (0.76×), 26 purchases, CPA $131.82 (1.13× median). ACTIVE. **My call: CUT.**

3. `pdf-company-02-creative-03` — $1,155 in active TEST campaign, ROAS 1.29 (0.71×), 7 purchases, CPA $165.05 (**1.42× median**), 7d trend further declining. **My call: CUT.** Test concluded negatively.

4. `pdf-company-02-creative-06` — $587 test spend, ROAS 0.38 (0.21× baseline), **1 purchase**, CPA $587 (5× median!). Lifecycle blocked. 7d ROAS 1.14 (recovery from 0 base but still below baseline). **My call: CUT.** Single-purchase at 5× median CPA is a failed test, not "not enough data."

5. `pdf-company-02-creative-09` — $445 test spend, ROAS 0.72 (0.40×), 2 purchases, CPA $222 (**1.91× median**), **7d ROAS 0** (tanked). **My call: CUT.** Below any reasonable threshold. Trend collapsed to zero.

**Scale candidates:**

6. `pdf-company-02-creative-07` — $501 test spend, 30d ROAS 4.21 (2.60× baseline), **7d ROAS 9.24** (surging 2.19× vs 30d), 8 purchases, CPA $62.65 (**0.52× median**). **My call: SCALE IMMEDIATELY before momentum fades.** Hot creative accelerating hard.

7. `pdf-company-02-creative-04` — $784 test, 30d ROAS 2.65 (1.64×), 10 purchases, CPA $78.41 (0.65× median), 7d trend 0.78×. **My call: SCALE REVIEW or TEST MORE at elevated budget.** Strong working test row.

**Test-campaign strong_relative rows that deserve consideration:**

8. `pdf-company-02-creative-05` — $608 test, 30d ROAS 2.56 (1.58×), 5 purchases, CPA ~median. **My call: TEST MORE / SCALE REVIEW.** In an active test campaign, 1.58× baseline is a meaningful winner.

9. `pdf-company-02-creative-08` — $458 test, 30d ROAS 2.50 (1.54×), 4 purchases, **7d trend 1.05×** (stable). **My call: TEST MORE / SCALE REVIEW.** Same pattern.

10. `pdf-company-02-creative-10` — $424 test, 30d ROAS 2.12 (1.31×), 4 purchases, **7d trend 1.51×** (improving). **My call: TEST MORE.** Trend accelerating.

**TheSwaf strategy summary:** Five clear cuts ($6,930 + $3,427 + $1,155 + $587 + $445 = $11.5k burn to stop). Two clear scale candidates with one urgently accelerating (creative-07). Three test-more candidates where a buyer wants to push more budget.

**TheSwaf weighted score:**
- Scale decisions (creative-04, 05, 07, 08, 10): (1.0 + 0.2 + 0.85 + 0.2 + 0.3) × 3 weight = 7.65 / 15 possible
- Cut decisions (creative-01, 02, 03, 06, 09): (1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 0.2 + 0.1) × 3 weight = 9.9 / 15 possible
- **TheSwaf: 17.55 / 30 = 58.5%**

**Combined weighted score: (37% + 58.5%) / 2 = 47.75%, minus semantic-confusion and trend-blindness penalties ≈ 45/100.**

### 4. Systemic Failures Discovered in This Audit

**Systemic Failure #1: Trend blindness.** The system classifies on 30-day metrics. It does not factor 7d/30d ROAS ratio into segmentation. Five IwaStore rows have 7d ROAS at 0.25×–0.40× of 30d ROAS — all labeled `Watch`. A real media buyer looks at the 7-day trend first and cuts declining creatives without waiting for 30-day confirmation. The current system gives passive Watch labels to creatives that a buyer would have cut two weeks ago.

**Systemic Failure #2: `Protect` label is semantically overloaded.** It currently fires on:
- Paused historical winners (IwaStore creative-01) — buyer needs "reactivate" or "archive" guidance, not "do not touch"
- `strong_relative` in active test campaigns (TheSwaf creative-05, creative-08) — in a test campaign, `strong_relative` is a scale candidate signal, not a protect signal
- `stable_winner` at 1.31× baseline in test context (TheSwaf creative-10) — borderline

Four different operator meanings for one label. `Protect` should mean exactly one thing: "actively delivering shipped winner, do not touch." It doesn't today.

**Systemic Failure #3: Cut floor too strict for accounts with lower ROAS baselines.** $1,000 spend + 4 purchases + 0.8× baseline is the Cut admission. TheSwaf creative-09 ($445, ROAS 0.72, 7d ROAS 0) is a clear cut by any media buyer standard but sits in Watch because the spend floor gates it out. For accounts with lower baselines and smaller test budgets, the floor should scale to account size (e.g., `max($500, 2× account median spend)`).

**Systemic Failure #4: Active-test-campaign context is not weighted into Scale decisions.** `strong_relative` rows in active test campaigns should be treated as candidates for `Scale Review` or `Test More` — the whole point of a test campaign is to surface winners. Current policy treats `strong_relative` + `stable_winner` as `Protect` regardless of whether the campaign is a standard scaling campaign or an explicitly-named test. Three TheSwaf rows (creative-05, creative-08, creative-10) in an ACTIVE `TEST — EMB - CreativeTest - Apr2026` campaign get Protect labels when they should be scale-review candidates.

**Systemic Failure #5: No reactivation path for paused historical winners.** The `/creatives` page shows paused winners with `Protect` or `Scale Review` labels and no instruction verb. A buyer needs to know: "reactivate in scaling ad set", "archive, extract learning for variant", or "retest in fresh context". The system has `Retest` as a taxonomy label but it never fires (0 rows across all audits). Paused winners should route to `Retest` or a new `Reactivate` signal.

**Systemic Failure #6: No urgency signal for accelerating creatives.** TheSwaf creative-07 has 7d ROAS 9.24 vs 30d ROAS 4.21 — a 2.19× acceleration. The label is `Scale Review` but the instruction doesn't flag the recent surge. A media buyer needs to know: act now before momentum fades, not just "review sometime."

**Systemic Failure #7: CPA signal is not surfacing as a blocker.** IwaStore creative-05 has CPA at 1.97× account median — that alone is a cut signal. The label is `Watch`. CPA-over-median is not factored into segmentation. For scaling decisions and for cut decisions, CPA ratio vs median is as important as ROAS ratio — current policy uses ROAS alone.

### 5. Adsecute Score: 45/100 — Brutal Breakdown

**What Adsecute gets right (55% of stakes):**
- Three TheSwaf cuts (creative-01 at $6,930, creative-02 at $3,427, creative-03 at $1,155) are correct. These are the largest burn cases in the cohort. The Cut path fix delivered on the most dangerous failures.
- Two clear Scale Review cases (IwaStore creative-10, TheSwaf creative-04 and creative-07) correctly surface.
- The taxonomy labels exist and the UI uses them.

**What Adsecute gets wrong or misses (45% of stakes):**
- 3 clear scale misses (IwaStore creative-04, TheSwaf creative-05, creative-08) — test-campaign winners buried in Watch/Protect.
- 4 clear cut/refresh misses (IwaStore creative-06, creative-07 both in Watch; TheSwaf creative-06 in Not Enough Data; creative-09 in Watch).
- 5 IwaStore rows with collapsed 7d trends labeled Watch — systemic trend blindness.
- 4+ paused winner rows with no actionable reactivation guidance.
- 1 urgently-accelerating creative (TheSwaf creative-07) with no urgency signal.
- 3 test-campaign `strong_relative` rows misrouted to Protect.

**This is not 85/100 (TRUSTWORTHY ENOUGH). This is 45/100. The previous verdict was wrong.**

### 6. What Must Be Fixed Next (Targeted, Deterministic, Fixture-Backed)

Four changes in priority order. All narrow. No rebuild.

**Fix #1 (highest priority): 7-day trend collapse as a Cut/Refresh admission signal.**
Admit `Cut` (review-required) OR `Refresh` when:
- `(recent7d.roas / mid30d.roas) ≤ 0.40` (trend collapsed to ≤40% of 30-day)
- `mid30d.roas < account.medianRoas` (below baseline)
- `spend30d ≥ max($300, 1.5× account.medianSpend)` (meaningful test weight — lower than current $1000 floor)
- `impressions30d ≥ 5000` (non-trivial exposure)

Route: if fatigue-pattern (declining trend on previously-stable lifecycle) → `Refresh`; otherwise → `Cut`.

Fixtures:
- IwaStore `creative-06` shape: $418 active test, 7d/30d ratio 0.26, below baseline → expected `Cut` (currently `Watch`).
- TheSwaf `creative-09` shape: $445 active test, 7d ROAS 0 from 30d 0.72, below baseline → expected `Cut` (currently `Watch`).

**Fix #2: CPA ratio as a blocker signal.**
When `mid30d.cpa ≥ 1.5× account.medianCpa` AND `mid30d.roas < account.medianRoas` AND meaningful spend → admit `Refresh` or `Cut` (supplements ROAS signal — CPA ratio blowout is a distinct media-buyer tell).

Fixture:
- IwaStore `creative-05` shape: CPA $76 vs median $38 (1.97×), ROAS 1.10× baseline declining → expected `Refresh` (currently `Watch`).

**Fix #3: `strong_relative` in active test campaigns elevates to `Test More` / `Scale Review`.**
When:
- `relativeStrengthClass = strong_relative`
- campaign is in an active/non-paused state AND named-as-test OR objective is explicitly testing-oriented
- `lifecycleState = stable_winner` OR `validating`
- `spend30d ≥ $300` AND `purchases30d ≥ 3`

Then admit `Scale Review` or `Test More` instead of `Protect`.

Fixtures:
- TheSwaf `creative-05` shape (1.58× baseline, 5 purchases, active test) → expected `Scale Review` or `Test More` (currently `Protect`).
- TheSwaf `creative-08` shape (1.54× baseline, 4 purchases, active test, improving trend) → expected `Test More` (currently `Protect`).

**Fix #4: Paused historical winners → `Retest` with reactivation verb.**
When `campStatus = PAUSED` OR `adSetStatus = CAMPAIGN_PAUSED` AND `primaryAction = hold_no_touch` AND lifetime evidence strong:
- If `relativeStrengthClass ∈ {strong_relative, review_only_scale_candidate}` → `Retest` with instruction "Reactivate in fresh ad set for scale review"
- Else → `Retest` with instruction "Archive; extract learning for new variant"

Fixtures:
- IwaStore `creative-01` shape: $2,365 lifetime, ROAS 4.31, 60 purchases, paused campaign, none relStrClass → expected `Retest` with "Archive or extract learning" instruction.
- IwaStore `creative-02` shape: $1,672 lifetime, ROAS 5.62, 58 purchases, campaign active but creative inactive → expected `Retest` or `Scale Review` with "Reactivate in scaling ad set" instruction.

**Out of scope for this pass (deferred):**
- Urgency flag for accelerating creatives (TheSwaf creative-07 7d surge) — instruction-body enhancement, lower priority.
- Semantic rename/split of `Protect` label — large change, defer until above fixes land.
- Campaign-benchmark automatic evaluation in test campaigns — policy decision, not current pass.

### 7. Expected Post-Fix State

After these four fixes, the audit rerun should produce:
- IwaStore: ≥ 3 Cut/Refresh rows (up from 0), ≥ 1 Retest row (paused winner reactivation path), ≥ 3 Scale Review rows (same as today).
- TheSwaf: ≥ 4 Cut rows (up from 3 — adds creative-09), ≥ 4 Scale Review/Test More rows (up from 2 — adds creative-05, creative-08, possibly creative-10), `Protect` drops to 1.
- Combined sample: Watch share drops from 12 to ~5–6, Cut share grows from 9 to ~13–15, Scale Review grows from 5 to ~7–9.
- Critical decision error rate: target ≤ 10% (currently ~35% on scale/cut directional calls).
- Adsecute score: target 80+/100 after fixes.

**Only after that post-fix audit produces those targets should Creative Segmentation Recovery be declared production-acceptable.**

### Final Chat Summary (this section)

**Verdict:** TARGETED FIXES STILL NEEDED. Previous "TRUSTWORTHY ENOUGH" verdict retracted.

**Adsecute score on the two flagship accounts: 45/100.**

**Top 5 systemic failures:**
1. Trend blindness — 7-day collapse not factored into segmentation; 5 IwaStore rows in Watch that should be Refresh/Cut
2. `Protect` label semantically overloaded — paused winners, test-campaign strong_relatives, and stable winners all share one label that means different things
3. Cut floor too strict for low-baseline / low-budget accounts — TheSwaf creative-09 ($445 / ROAS 0.72 / 7d 0) sits in Watch
4. Active-test-campaign `strong_relative` routes to `Protect` instead of `Scale Review` / `Test More` — 3 TheSwaf rows affected
5. No reactivation path for paused historical winners — `Retest` label exists in taxonomy but never fires; buyers get `Protect` with no action verb

**Critical mismatches (high stakes):**
- 3 Scale direction misses: IwaStore creative-04 ($777, 1.51× baseline, active test → Watch); TheSwaf creative-05 and creative-08 (`strong_relative` in active test → Protect)
- 4 Cut direction misses: IwaStore creative-06 (active test collapsing → Watch); IwaStore creative-07 (7d ROAS 0 → Watch); TheSwaf creative-06 ($587 burn 1 purchase → Not Enough Data); TheSwaf creative-09 ($445, 7d tanked to 0 → Watch)

**Recommended next move:** Implement four targeted deterministic fixes — (1) 7-day trend-collapse admission to Cut/Refresh, (2) CPA-ratio blowout admission, (3) test-campaign `strong_relative` elevation to `Scale Review`/`Test More`, (4) paused-winner routing to `Retest` with reactivation verb — validate against specific per-row fixtures from IwaStore and TheSwaf, rerun the audit, require the score to reach ≥ 80/100 before declaring product-acceptable.
