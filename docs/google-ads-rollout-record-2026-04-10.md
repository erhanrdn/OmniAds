# Google Ads Advisor Rollout Record

Date recorded: `2026-04-10`

This note captures the operator-first Google Ads advisor rollout validation
performed after deterministic action-card coverage was completed across the live
recommendation families, while write-back remained disabled.

## Rollout Summary

- Shipping posture validated: operator-first / manual-plan-first
- Write-back posture validated: disabled
- Action contract validated: native `google_ads_advisor_action_v2`
- AI structured assist posture during this rollout:
  - global flag disabled
  - no business allowlist configured
  - residual scope only
- Rollout runbook:
  - `docs/google-ads-rollout-runbook.md`

## Validation Commands

The following commands were executed during this rollout:

1. `npm run google:ads:product-gate -- <businessId> --skip-build --json`
2. `npm run google:ads:health -- <businessId>`
3. `npm run google:ads:state-check -- <businessId>`
4. `npm run google:ads:advisor-readiness -- <businessId> 2026-03-13 2026-04-09`
5. `npm run google:ads:advisor-refresh -- <businessId> --json`

Note:

- `--skip-build` was used in the live per-business gate because the local build had already passed before rollout validation started.
- The truthful advisor window for this validation was the refreshed snapshot `asOfDate` window `2026-03-13 -> 2026-04-09`.

## Rollout Verdict

Advisor surface verdict for the current shipping boundary: `GO`

Reason:

- connected businesses refreshed successfully into native `google_ads_advisor_action_v2`
- operator window readiness passed on the truthful snapshot window
- product gate passed the core advisor, warehouse, and admin visibility sections
- write-back remained disabled
- AI structured assist remained optional and inactive by default

This is not a write-back or autonomy signoff.

## Known Non-Blocking Observations

1. Product gate stayed at `overallLevel=WARN` in these live runs because:
   - `--skip-build` was used during the per-business validation
   - retention execution remains intentionally `dry_run`

2. Historical / maintenance queue pressure is still visible in admin telemetry for some businesses.
   - This did not block native advisor snapshot generation in the validated sample.

3. AI structured assist showed `eligibleCount=0` in the validated sample.
   - This matches the current design: the live recommendation families are mostly deterministic, and AI scope is residual only.

## Post-Rollout Monitoring

1. Re-run `npm run google:ads:product-gate -- <businessId>` at `T0 + 24h`
2. Re-run `npm run google:ads:advisor-refresh -- <businessId> --json`
3. Watch `/admin/sync-health` for:
   - dead letters
   - stale maintenance pressure
   - queue growth without recent checkpoint movement
4. Keep write-back disabled
