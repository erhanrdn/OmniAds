# Phase 01 Truth Foundation

## Scope

Phase 01 is limited to trust, provenance, and release safety for the existing Meta and Creative surfaces.

- No new decision families ship here.
- No commercial-truth layer ships here.
- No write-back or execution logic ships here.

The contract for this phase is:

1. operator-visible metrics must map cleanly to their real source fields
2. deterministic decision-engine output must not be labeled as AI
3. AI commentary must remain clearly optional and secondary
4. every critical operator surface must have a browser smoke path and a release runbook

## Truth ownership rules

- Meta KPI and campaign/ad set metrics:
  - source of truth is the existing Meta live/warehouse serving layer
  - the page contract remains `docs/meta-page-ui-contract.md`
- Meta recommendations:
  - source of truth is the deterministic recommendation engine behind `/api/meta/recommendations`
  - page status truth class is `deterministic_decision_engine`
- Creative metrics:
  - source of truth is the raw Meta creatives row mapper plus explicit derived formulas in `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page-support.tsx` and `components/creatives/creative-truth.ts`
- Creative decision signals:
  - source of truth is `/api/creatives/decisions`
  - response provenance is only `cache` or `deterministic`
- Creative commentary:
  - source of truth is `/api/creatives/commentary`
  - response provenance is only `ai` or `fallback`
  - commentary is optional narrative and must not replace the deterministic report/score
- Proxy / compatibility metrics:
  - if a surface reuses another field as a heuristic placeholder, the label must explicitly say `proxy` or `compat`
  - misleading export labels were removed instead of silently reusing semantically different data

## Meta Metric Matrix

This matrix covers operator-visible metrics on the current Meta page. For the broader surface/readiness inventory, see `docs/meta-page-ui-contract.md`.

| Surface | UI label | UI key | API field | CSV header | Share payload field | Truth owner | Nullability / readiness notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| KPI row | Total Spend | `totalSpend` | `/api/meta/summary -> totals.spend` with `/api/meta/campaigns -> row.spend` fallback | n/a | n/a | Meta canonical overview summary / campaign serving fallback | Required KPI. Masked as preparing when selected-range page readiness is not ready. |
| KPI row | Total Revenue | `totalRevenue` | `/api/meta/summary -> totals.revenue` with `/api/meta/campaigns -> row.revenue` fallback | n/a | n/a | Meta canonical overview summary / campaign serving fallback | Required KPI. Attributed purchase revenue. |
| KPI row | Avg. CPA | `avgCpa` | `/api/meta/summary -> totals.cpa` with campaigns aggregate fallback | n/a | n/a | Meta canonical overview summary / campaign serving fallback | Required KPI. Displays `-` while masked/preparing. |
| KPI row | Blended ROAS | `blendedRoas` | `/api/meta/summary -> totals.roas` with campaigns aggregate fallback | n/a | n/a | Meta canonical overview summary / campaign serving fallback | Required KPI. |
| Campaign list / detail | Spend | `campaign.spend` | `/api/meta/campaigns -> row.spend` | n/a | n/a | Meta live or warehouse campaign rows | Required once campaign rows are present. |
| Campaign list / detail | Revenue | `campaign.revenue` | `/api/meta/campaigns -> row.revenue` | n/a | n/a | Meta live or warehouse campaign rows | Required once campaign rows are present. |

| Ad set drilldown | Spend | `adset.spend` | `/api/meta/adsets -> row.spend` | n/a | n/a | Meta live or warehouse ad set rows | Conditional drilldown. Hidden until a campaign is selected. |
| Ad set drilldown | ROAS | `adset.roas` | `/api/meta/adsets -> row.roas` | n/a | n/a | Meta live or warehouse ad set rows | Conditional drilldown. |
| Ad set drilldown | CPA | `adset.cpa` | `/api/meta/adsets -> row.cpa` | n/a | n/a | Meta live or warehouse ad set rows | Conditional drilldown. |
| Ad set drilldown | CTR | `adset.ctr` | `/api/meta/adsets -> row.inlineLinkClickCtr` with `row.ctr` fallback | n/a | n/a | Meta live or warehouse ad set rows | Conditional drilldown. UI prefers link CTR when present. |

## Creative Proxy / Compatibility Metrics

These values remain available for continuity, but the label must make the reuse explicit.

| UI label | UI key | Underlying field | CSV header | Share payload field | Truth owner | Nullability / readiness notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| First-impression proxy (thumbstop) | `firstFrameRetention` | `thumbstop` | removed in Phase 01 | `thumbstop` | Compatibility alias only | Visible only where legacy column pickers/shared reports need continuity. |
| Link CTR (compat) | `ctrOutbound` | derived `link_clicks / impressions` | removed in Phase 01 | `linkCtr` | Compatibility alias only | Kept only as an explicitly marked compat alias. |
| Completion proxy (100% plays) | `holdRate` | `video100` | removed in Phase 01 | `video100` | Compatibility alias only | Video-only proxy. |
| Hook proxy (thumbstop) | `hookScore` | `thumbstop` | removed in Phase 01 | `thumbstop` | Heuristic proxy only | Not a model score. |
| Watch proxy (50% plays) | `watchScore` | `video50` | removed in Phase 01 | `video50` | Heuristic proxy only | Video-only proxy. |

| Average order value (website) / (Shop) | `averageOrderValueWebsite` / `averageOrderValueShop` | derived `purchase_value / purchases` | removed in Phase 01 | `purchaseValue` + `purchases` | Compatibility alias only | Both labels intentionally point to the same AOV formula until a distinct commerce split exists. |
| Website purchase ROAS | `websitePurchaseRoas` | `roas` | removed in Phase 01 | `roas` | Compatibility alias only | Alias only until website-vs-shop attribution splits exist. |
| Click to website purchase ratio | `clickToWebsitePurchaseRatio` | derived `purchases / link_clicks` | removed in Phase 01 | `clickToPurchase` | Compatibility alias only | Alias only until a distinct website purchase metric exists. |

## Decision And Commentary Provenance Matrix

| Surface | UI label | Route | Response provenance | Truth owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Meta recommendations | `Recommendations`, `Run Recommendations`, `Refresh Recommendations` | `/api/meta/recommendations` | deterministic only | `buildMetaRecommendations` | Optional page surface. Status truth class is `deterministic_decision_engine`. |
| Creative decision controls | `Decision Signals`, `Run Signals`, `Refresh Signals` | `/api/creatives/decisions` | `cache` or `deterministic` | deterministic creative decision engine | Cached responses must render as cached, fresh responses must render as deterministic/non-AI. |
| Creative detail commentary | `AI interpretation` / commentary block | `/api/creatives/commentary` | `ai` or `fallback` | commentary generator plus deterministic fallback formatter | Commentary is secondary. Deterministic report, score, and factors remain the primary decision surface. |

## Export And Share Guarantees

- `toCsv()` and `toSharedCreative()` now share the same truthful field set for:
  - all clicks
  - link CTR
  - click-to-add-to-cart
  - click-to-purchase
- Misleading CSV headers removed in Phase 01:
  - `CTR outbound`
  - `First frame retention`
  - `Hold rate`
- Shared report payloads now carry the additional truthful fields required to keep public share pages aligned with the internal table:
  - `clicks`
  - `linkCtr`
  - `clickToAddToCart`

## Implementation anchors

- Creative mapper and export/share alignment:
  - `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page-support.tsx`
  - `components/creatives/creative-truth.ts`
  - `components/creatives/shareTableEngine.ts`
- Creative deterministic provenance:
  - `src/services/data-service-ai.ts`
  - `app/api/ai/creatives/decisions/route.ts`
  - `lib/migrations.ts`
- Meta page truth class and wording:
  - `lib/meta/status-types.ts`
  - `lib/meta/page-contract.ts`
  - `app/api/meta/status/route.ts`
  - `components/meta/meta-account-recs.tsx`
