# Operator Rebuild Closure Audit

## Status

Operator-rebuild is closed and accepted as of April 13, 2026.

This document freezes the accepted baseline that emerged from Steps 5 through 10 and records the Step 11 closure hardening that makes that baseline durable.

## Re-Verified Current Truth

Verified before Step 11 edits on April 13, 2026:

Classification:

* current actual `origin/main`
  * `082c45624bd8533896497da73f5b760557a56466`
* current live runtime SHA
  * `0dbd9cff0b1dc383e06537ebdc1068db76b9686a`
* current release-authority live SHA
  * `0dbd9cff0b1dc383e06537ebdc1068db76b9686a`
* current release-authority main SHA
  * `082c45624bd8533896497da73f5b760557a56466`
* runtime/main aligned or drifted
  * drifted on exact SHA
  * explainable as program continuity drift because main only advanced through the Step 10 continuity commit and the Step 11 closure/hardening commit
* non-program commits after the Step 10 continuity state
  * none
* whether the accepted Step 10 understanding still holds
  * yes, in substance

## What The Rebuild Changed

The operator-rebuild program changed the operator-facing baseline in these ways:

* Meta now leads with an operator-first daily hierarchy instead of burying decision authority under secondary context
* Meta selected-campaign drilldown stays reachable from the operator surface and preserves decision reasoning plus ad-set action context
* Creative review now uses preview truth as an explicit gate on authoritative wording
* Creative detail keeps deterministic decision authority primary
* AI creative commentary is support-only and never changes the deterministic decision
* the Creative Decision OS drawer is explicitly support framing, not the primary worklist
* reviewer and commercial smokes were stabilized around the accepted operator baseline
* Step 10 proved the non-demo path on `IwaStore` and then tore the temporary proof path down completely

## Accepted Baseline Truth

The frozen baseline is:

* Meta operator-first hierarchy from Step 5
* Creative preview-truth and decision-first behavior from Step 6
* live deploy and verification posture from Step 7
* reviewer smoke stability from Steps 8 and 9
* non-demo proof success plus teardown semantics from Step 10

Commercial Truth relocation remains compatible with this baseline, but it is not itself part of the operator-rebuild step chain.

## Proof Used

Acceptance rests on the combined proof chain:

* Step 5 Meta operator-first acceptance
* Step 6 Creative preview-truth and decision-first acceptance
* Step 7 live deploy and verification posture acceptance
* Steps 8 and 9 reviewer smoke and continuity acceptance
* Step 10 non-demo live proof on `IwaStore`
* Step 11 regression-hardening verification:
  * targeted Vitest guards added/tightened
  * reviewer smoke passed on live
  * commercial-truth smoke passed on live accepted-path coverage
  * `npm run build` passed
  * `npx tsc --noEmit` passed after build regenerated `.next/types`

## Temporary Proof Path Used In Step 10

Step 10 used a narrow temporary proof-only path because all benchmark businesses were still effective plan `starter` and `/creatives` was Growth-gated.

That temporary path was:

* one temporary non-reviewer user
* one active `guest` membership to `IwaStore` only
* one direct temporary session
* one temporary user-level `plan_override = 'growth'`

That proof path did not widen to:

* superadmin
* extra benchmark-business memberships
* permanent benchmark-business plan changes

## Confirmation That The Temporary Proof Path Was Removed

Step 10 already removed:

* temporary sessions
* temporary membership
* temporary user
* local temp auth artifacts

Step 11 confirmed the closure posture and did not recreate:

* temporary admin users
* temporary sessions
* temporary memberships
* user-level plan overrides
* temp auth storage files

## Step 11 Regression Guards Added Or Tightened

Step 11 hardened the accepted baseline with:

* Meta campaign list ordering test that protects operator-first action ordering
* Creative detail test that protects preview-ready support-only AI framing
* Creative Decision OS overview test that protects preview-truth wording and accepted lane vocabulary
* Creative Decision OS drawer test that protects support framing and primary-worklist wording
* reviewer smoke hardening:
  * idempotent details opening
  * stable scroll handling
  * accepted preview-truth and support-only wording checks
  * selected-campaign URL reachability check
* commercial-truth smoke hardening:
  * accepted `Decision support` trigger label
  * accepted `creative-opportunity-board` selector
  * accepted drawer support framing
  * stable campaign reasoning/open-state checks
  * strict-selector fix for the Commercial Truth page heading

## What Remains Outside This Program

Still outside operator-rebuild:

* Step 12
* new product feature work
* new proof-session creation
* auth redesign
* release-authority redesign without a proven defect
* deploy work unless a real regression requires it
* permanent benchmark-business access work
* reopening the Step 10 temporary proof path just to re-collect evidence

## Future Work Rules

Future work must not reopen by default:

* Steps 5 through 10
* the Step 10 temporary proof path
* accepted wording/structure debates that were already settled

Future work should start from:

* the accepted Meta operator surface
* the accepted Creative operator surface
* the accepted reviewer/commercial smoke baseline
* the closed proof-path posture

Only reopen the rebuild chain if current verification proves a real regression in the accepted baseline.

## Final Verdict

Step 11 is `accepted`.

Reason:

* the accepted baseline was re-verified against current repo/live truth
* durable regression guards were added
* closure documentation now exists in a durable form
* continuity docs now mark the program closed and accepted
* no temporary proof access was recreated
