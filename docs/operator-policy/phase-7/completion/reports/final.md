# Phase 7 Final Report

Branch: `feature/adsecute-production-readiness-observability`

Scope: production-safe operator decision telemetry staging, targeted operator clarity hardening, small network/performance safeguards, runtime smoke, and Phase 8 handoff. This phase does not add automatic account-push execution and does not loosen queue, push, or apply gates.

## Branches And PRs

- Working branch: `feature/adsecute-production-readiness-observability`
- Base branch: `main`
- PR: pending at report creation time.
- PRs merged at report creation time: none for Phase 7 yet.

## Files Changed

- `lib/operator-decision-telemetry.ts`
- `lib/operator-prescription.ts`
- `lib/creative-operator-surface.ts`
- `components/creatives/CreativeDecisionOsOverview.tsx`
- Phase 7 tests in `lib/*` and Creative overview tests
- `docs/operator-policy/phase-7/completion/reports/final.md`
- `docs/operator-policy/phase-8/handoff.md`

## Observability

- Added a staged `operator-decision-telemetry-event.v1` helper for production-safe event construction.
- Added aggregate rollout counters that avoid action fingerprints and evidence hashes by default.
- Kept stdout emission disabled by default behind `OPERATOR_DECISION_TELEMETRY_STDOUT=1`.
- Normalized source surfaces to allowlisted values instead of exporting arbitrary surface labels.
- Tests prove telemetry events include policy version, push readiness, instruction kind, source surface, blocked reason, missing-evidence tokens, action fingerprint, and evidence hash while excluding raw entity names and sensitive sample identifiers.

## Performance And Network

- Creative quick filters now bucket creatives in one pass instead of scanning all creatives once per filter.
- A server-side Command Center `viewKey` request change was evaluated but not kept because the existing smoke path depends on client-side fallback view iteration; the safer Phase 8 version should add a payload mode without breaking fallback navigation.
- Larger performance findings were documented for Phase 8: duplicate Meta Decision OS compilation across recommendations/decision-os routes, Creative metadata/history refetch overlap, Command Center view payload size, and Command Center preview/apply snapshot rebuilds.

## Product Clarity

- Creative scale primary moves now include the preferred target ad set in the action sentence when deterministic deployment context exposes one.
- If the target is unavailable or review-required, the primary move says target placement needs review instead of implying a hidden target.
- `hold_monitor` rows now read as "Hold and watch" / "Monitor hold" so they do not collapse into stop, truth-blocked, or protected-winner meanings.
- Creative overview summary changed the old "Hold" count to "Blocked review" for rows that are stop/blocked-review oriented.

## Command Center Safety

- Phase 7 did not change queue, push, or apply eligibility rules.
- The prescription and telemetry helpers read existing deterministic safety state and cannot override policy, provenance, evidence source, or apply allowlists.
- Contextual, demo, snapshot, fallback, non-live, missing-provenance, and policy-blocked actions remain non-push eligible under existing gates.

## Data Privacy

- Telemetry events exclude raw business IDs, ad account IDs, entity names, actor IDs/emails, notes, and free-form reason text.
- `actionFingerprint` and `evidenceHash` remain pseudonymous stable identifiers. Aggregate rollout counters intentionally exclude them.
- The helper does not write logs unless the explicit stdout env flag is enabled.

## Tests Added

- Operator telemetry event and aggregate privacy tests.
- Creative primary move target-context tests.
- Creative target-unavailable copy tests.
- Creative hold-monitor disambiguation tests.
- Creative overview copy update test.

## Checks Run

- `npm test -- lib/operator-prescription.test.ts lib/creative-operator-surface.test.ts lib/operator-decision-telemetry.test.ts` - passed, 26 tests.
- `npm test -- lib/operator-prescription.test.ts lib/creative-operator-surface.test.ts lib/operator-decision-telemetry.test.ts lib/command-center.test.ts` - passed, 62 tests.
- `npm test -- components/creatives/CreativeDecisionOsOverview.test.tsx components/creatives/CreativeDetailExperience.test.tsx components/creatives/CreativesTableSection.test.tsx` - passed, 10 tests.
- `npm test -- lib/operator-decision-telemetry.test.ts lib/operator-prescription.test.ts lib/creative-operator-surface.test.ts components/creatives/CreativeDecisionOsOverview.test.tsx` - passed, 26 tests.
- `npm test` - passed, 292 files / 1984 tests.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` - passed.
- `npm run build` - passed.
- `git diff --check` - passed.
- Hidden/bidi/control scan over `docs`, `lib`, `components`, `app`, and `src` - passed.
- `npm run test:smoke:local` through the approved SSH DB tunnel - passed, 5 Playwright tests passed and 1 configured execution canary skipped.
- No `lint` script exists in `package.json`.

## Runtime Smoke

Runtime smoke used the owner-approved localhost path:

- SSH tunnel to the database host through the app server.
- `DATABASE_URL` and `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` set locally without printing values.
- Playwright web server served `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.
- Smoke covered reviewer login, commercial operator login, Meta recommendations, Creative decision surfaces, Commercial Truth, Meta operating mode, Creative context, and Command Center-adjacent fallback view navigation.
- Result: 5 passed, 1 configured execution canary skipped.

## Remaining Risks

- Meta recommendations and Decision OS can still compile overlapping expensive surfaces during manual analysis.
- Creative selected metadata/history and Decision OS can still overlap source reads.
- Command Center execution preview/apply still rebuilds broad snapshots before validating a single action.
- Those require larger source-sharing and compact lookup work and are deferred to Phase 8 because they exceed this hardening slice.

## Completion Status

- Phase 7 code is targeted-test clean on the feature branch at report creation time.
- Phase 7 is not complete on `main` until the normal PR is opened, reviewed, checked, runtime-smoked, and merged.
- Phase 8 may start only after Phase 7 is merged to `main`.
