# Phase 5 Completion Report

## Scope

Phase 5 productized the deterministic Meta and Creative policies into compact operator prescriptions. It did not change push authority, selected-range authority, or provider execution.

Branch: `feature/adsecute-operator-prescription-layer`

## Branches and PRs

- Working branch: `feature/adsecute-operator-prescription-layer`
- PR: to be opened after final local runtime smoke and branch push.
- Main merge: only through PR after checks, review, and runtime gate pass.

## Prescription Contract Summary

Added `operator-instruction.v1` as a deterministic adapter over existing `operator-policy.v1`.

The contract exposes:

- `instructionKind`
- `operatorVerb`
- `headline`
- `primaryMove`
- `targetScope`
- `targetEntity`
- `reasonSummary`
- `evidenceStrength`
- `missingEvidence`
- `nextObservation`
- `invalidActions`
- `amountGuidance`
- `pushReadiness`
- `queueEligible`
- `canApply`
- `urgency`
- confidence and reliability metadata
- policy source
- provenance, evidence hash, and action fingerprint where present

The adapter does not decide final authority. It translates deterministic policy outputs into operator-readable instructions and fails closed when policy/provenance is missing.

## Scenario Tests Added

- Scale-ready instruction exposes an action without inventing a budget or bid amount.
- Promising or under-sampled reads become watch instructions, not scale commands.
- Non-live evidence stays contextual and push blocked.
- Meta blocked state produces a clear do-not-act instruction.
- Protected winners are visibly protected and not hidden as generic hold.
- Meta surface instructions downgrade when the row is not command-ready.
- Creative surface instructions distinguish scale/watch instructions.
- Command Center recomputes fail-closed instructions when policy is missing or blocked.

## Data Gaps

- Creative campaign/ad set context can be sample-derived after grouping; prescriptions avoid treating it as execution authority.
- Frequency/fatigue can be partially unavailable; the system does not invent frequency-based prescriptions.
- Creative provider execution identifiers remain incomplete for direct push execution.
- Safe budget/bid amounts are not deterministically calculated in Phase 5. The instruction contract explicitly labels amount as unavailable when no safe amount exists.

## UI Integration Summary

- Meta Decision OS rows now show compact operator instruction, why-now, evidence strength, amount availability, watch-next, and do-not guidance.
- Creative Decision OS overview now shows `Operator Instructions` rather than only policy classifications.
- Creative detail panel now surfaces the operator instruction above raw segment/readiness metrics.
- Command Center action sheet now leads with `Operator instruction`, why-now, and how-much availability.

No broad layout redesign was performed.

## Command Center Safety Result

- Prescription text does not change queue eligibility.
- Throughput decoration recomputes instruction from the current policy so stale command language does not survive when policy is removed or blocked.
- Missing Creative operator policy remains non-actionable.
- Snapshot/demo/fallback/contextual evidence remains blocked from queue/push through existing policy gates.

## Runtime Smoke Result

Passed on the owner-approved localhost SSH database tunnel path.

- `npm run test:smoke:local` passed.
- Playwright result: 5 passed, 1 execution canary skipped.
- Smoke covered `/platforms/meta`, `/command-center`, `/creatives`, Creative Decision OS drawer/detail surfaces, and Commercial Truth smoke.
- No secrets, tokens, cookies, raw business ids, or ad account ids were recorded in this report.

## Automated Checks

- `npm test` passed: 291 files / 1961 tests.
- Targeted prescription/policy/Command Center suite passed: 12 files / 107 tests.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passed.
- `npm run build` passed.
- `npm run test:smoke:local` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- Hidden/bidi/control character scan passed.
- No `lint` script is present in `package.json`.

## Remaining Risks

- UI density should be monitored with live high-volume accounts.
- Creative grouped row campaign/ad set labels should not be treated as provider-execution identity.
- Runtime smoke still needs final pass before PR merge.

## Completion Status

Phase 5 is code-ready after automated and runtime checks. It is complete only after PR review and PR merge into `main`.

Phase 6 may start only after Phase 5 is merged into `main`.
