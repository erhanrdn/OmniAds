# Adsecute Final Product Readiness

Status: Phase 8 branch readiness draft.

## What Adsecute Can Safely Do Now

- Compile Meta and Creative deterministic operator decisions from stable Operator Decision Context.
- Keep UI-selected reporting ranges as reporting context, not action authority.
- Classify operator work into action, protect, watch, investigate, blocked, and contextual states.
- Show operator instructions with provenance, policy readiness, evidence source, urgency, target context, and missing evidence.
- Queue and preview only rows that satisfy deterministic policy, provenance, evidence-source, and support-mode gates.
- Build Command Center execution previews for the explicitly supported Meta ad set action subset.
- Reject stale preview hashes, missing provenance, missing approval evidence, non-live provider scope, disabled feature flags, kill-switch blocks, and non-canary businesses before provider apply.

## Manual-Only Work

- Creative provider mutations remain manual-only.
- Meta campaign budget shifts, geo decisions, placement anomalies, no-touch rows, and unsupported ad set actions remain manual or review-only.
- Any row with demo, snapshot, fallback, unknown, contextual, or missing evidence remains non-push eligible.
- Any row missing complete provenance, evidence hash, source scope, or current policy approval remains manual-only.

## Push-Capable Action Subset

The only provider-backed execution subset is Meta ad set actions that are already in the existing allowlist:

- `pause`
- `recover`
- `scale_budget`
- `reduce_budget`

Even these are not automatic. They require:

- deterministic policy approval
- complete provenance and action fingerprint
- live evidence source
- supported execution capability
- current preview hash
- recorded workflow approval event
- operator edit permission
- accessible live provider state
- canary allowlist membership
- apply feature flag enabled
- kill switch inactive
- material provider-side delta
- rollback plan or recovery note

## Safety Gate Summary

- Push-to-account remains disabled by default through `META_EXECUTION_APPLY_ENABLED=0`.
- Canary scope is required through `META_EXECUTION_CANARY_BUSINESSES`.
- The kill switch remains explicit through `META_EXECUTION_KILL_SWITCH`.
- Preview hash now binds to preflight safety state, so apply/canary/approval changes stale the preview.
- Approval now requires a recorded approval event, not only an action status.
- Command Center provenance now requires evidence hash and source-scope integrity before queue or apply readiness.
- Execution audit entries returned to the UI/API are sanitized summaries, not raw provider payloads or actor PII.

## Observability Summary

- Operator decision telemetry has a staged sink posture through `OPERATOR_DECISION_TELEMETRY_SINK`.
- `stdout` telemetry remains explicitly staged, not production-ready.
- Telemetry export defensively sanitizes blocked reasons and missing-evidence tokens.
- Provider request audit paths and failure messages are sanitized before persistence and logs.
- Production retention, alert ownership, and durable metrics sink activation remain owner rollout tasks.

## Runtime Validation Summary

Phase 8 must pass automated checks and localhost/server smoke before merge. Runtime smoke should verify:

- `/platforms/meta` loads.
- `/creatives` loads.
- Command Center loads.
- Preview path renders for eligible actions.
- Disabled apply path explains the active gate.
- Reporting range changes do not mutate action identity.
- No real provider mutation occurs unless all feature flag, canary, approval, preview, and rollback gates pass.

## Known Risks

- Preview/apply still compiles upstream decision surfaces to resolve action fingerprints, but the lookup path no longer builds the full Command Center snapshot.
- Meta and Creative Decision OS builders still have broader shared-context duplication that should be optimized after safety rollout.
- A durable telemetry sink, retention policy, and alert owner are staged but not activated in this branch.

## Production Rollout Checklist

- Keep `META_EXECUTION_APPLY_ENABLED=0` until canary approval.
- Configure `META_EXECUTION_CANARY_BUSINESSES` with a single non-demo business before any apply test.
- Keep `META_EXECUTION_KILL_SWITCH=0` only during supervised canary windows.
- Enable telemetry sink staging before apply canary.
- Review sanitized execution audit summaries after every preview/apply attempt.
- Confirm rollback recovery notes for each supported action class.
- Expand one action class at a time only after preview, apply, validation, and rollback evidence are stable.

## Owner Decisions Still Required

- Choose the production telemetry sink and retention period.
- Assign alert ownership for blocked push spikes, apply failures, stale preview conflicts, and rollback failures.
- Approve the first canary business and supported action class.
- Explicitly authorize any future live provider mutation window.
