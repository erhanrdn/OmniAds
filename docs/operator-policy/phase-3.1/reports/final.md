## 3. Contract Changes

- Decision timing is now separated from reporting range across Meta, Creative, and Command Center paths.
- `startDate` / `endDate` remain backward-compatible reporting dates, not the authority anchor.
- `analyticsStartDate` / `analyticsEndDate` and `decisionAsOf` are the decision surface inputs used for stable identity.
- Per-row provenance is now part of the action-bearing contract, including `evidenceHash` and `actionFingerprint`.
- Queue eligibility and execution eligibility are now provenance-gated instead of being inferred from selected reporting dates.
- Legacy fallback recommendation behavior remains report-only and non-authoritative.

## 4. Meta Firewall Status

- Status: passed
- Meta Decision OS now keeps selected reporting dates separate from the stable decision window.
- Meta action identity is stable across analytics-range changes when the underlying decision evidence is unchanged.
- Meta action rows now carry provenance, `evidenceHash`, and `actionFingerprint`.
- Meta recommendation fallback stays tied to selected-range context and does not become authoritative.

## 5. Creative Firewall Status

- Status: passed
- Creative Decision OS now separates reporting dates from decision timing.
- Creative primary action identity is stable across reporting-range changes when the decision evidence is unchanged.
- Creative action-bearing rows now carry provenance, `evidenceHash`, and `actionFingerprint`.
- Selected-period Creative analysis remains contextual and does not rebind the primary action surface.

## 6. Workflow / Command Center Status

- Status: passed
- Command Center now preserves upstream provenance when present and falls back to deterministic local fingerprints only when provenance is absent.
- Missing provenance blocks default queue eligibility.
- Execution preview/apply paths reject the provider-backed path when provenance is missing.
- Legacy/demo/snapshot-style rows remain manual-only and do not become push eligible.

## 7. Tests Run And Results

Verified results:

- Targeted acceptance suite:
  - `npm test -- lib/operator-decision-metadata.test.ts lib/meta/analysis-state.test.ts components/meta/meta-analysis-status-card.test.tsx app/'(dashboard)'/platforms/meta/page.test.tsx app/'(dashboard)'/creatives/page-support.test.ts lib/meta/decision-os.test.ts app/api/meta/decision-os/route.test.ts app/api/meta/recommendations/route.test.ts lib/creative-decision-os.test.ts app/api/creatives/decision-os/route.test.ts lib/command-center.test.ts lib/command-center-execution-service.test.ts app/api/command-center/execution/route.test.ts app/api/command-center/execution/apply/route.test.ts app/api/command-center/execution/rollback/route.test.ts app/api/command-center/actions/route.test.ts app/api/command-center/actions/batch/route.test.ts app/api/command-center/actions/note/route.test.ts`
  - Result: passed, 18 files / 110 tests

  - No lint script exists in this repo

## 8. Known Limitations

- No runtime smoke test was run in this reporting pass.
- Merge confidence is limited to the checked unit, typecheck, diff, and build results.
- The fallback recommendation surface still exists as non-authoritative selected-range context.
- This report does not change branch state, push commits, or open a PR.

## 9. Safe To Keep On Feature Branch

Yes.

The current state is appropriate to keep on `feature/adsecute-decision-range-firewall` while review and any runtime smoke checks are pending.

## 10. Safe To Open PR

Yes.

The implementation slice is coherent, the acceptance suite passed, typecheck passed, build passed, and the report set is aligned on the scope boundary.

## 11. Safe To Merge Main

No.

It is not safe to merge `main` yet. PR review and runtime smoke validation are still pending, so mainline merge would be premature.
