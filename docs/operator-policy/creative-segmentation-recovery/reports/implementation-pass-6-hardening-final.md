# Creative Segmentation Implementation Pass 6 Hardening Final

Last updated: 2026-04-24 by Codex

## Result

This was a narrow hardening pass on top of merged pass 6.

Scope was limited to the `Test More` fatigue caveat trigger in the instruction layer.

No taxonomy, benchmark, Commercial Truth, or queue/push/apply behavior changed.

## Was The Fatigue-Caveat Review Issue Real?

Yes.

The issue on merged PR #44 was real on current `main`.

Root cause:

- `buildCreativeOperatorItem` always appends `creative.fatigue?.missingContext` into `nextObservation`
- `defaultPrimaryMove` uses `findFatigueObservation(nextObservation)` to decide whether `Test More` should say `watch fatigue pressure`
- `findFatigueObservation` previously matched any text containing `fatigue` or `frequency`

That meant missing-data notes like `Frequency unavailable` could be treated as if they were real fatigue pressure.

The visible effect was narrow but misleading:

- a normal `Test More` row could pick up a fatigue caveat in the instruction copy
- even when the row had no actual fatigue signal

## What Changed

The patch stayed narrow and local to the prescription layer.

Changed:

- tightened fatigue matching so only real fatigue/frequency-pressure wording counts
- excluded missing-data / unavailable-data phrases from the fatigue trigger

Current behavior:

- `Test More` + real fatigue or frequency-pressure observation => fatigue caveat appears
- `Test More` + `Frequency unavailable` or similar missing-data note => no fatigue caveat
- `Test More` + no fatigue-related observation => no fatigue caveat

This preserves the intended pass-6 behavior without letting free-text missing-context notes misfire.

## Validation

New / updated regression coverage:

- `Test More` + `Frequency unavailable` only => no fatigue caveat
- `Test More` + no fatigue-related observation => no fatigue caveat
- integrated creative surface regression for `Test More` with `Frequency unavailable`
- existing real-fatigue `Test More` regression still passes
- existing fatigued-winner / refresh-oriented fatigue regressions still pass

Targeted tests passed:

- `lib/operator-prescription.test.ts`
- `lib/creative-operator-surface.test.ts`
- `lib/creative-operator-policy.test.ts`

Result:

- `3` files passed
- `70` tests passed

Full validation passed:

- `npm test` => `296` files passed, `2075` tests passed
- `npm run build`
- `npx tsc --noEmit`
- `git diff --check`

Scans passed:

- hidden / bidi / control scan on touched docs/code
- raw ID scan on touched docs/code

## Runtime Smoke

Runtime smoke ran on the documented localhost + tunneled DB path.

Confirmed:

- `/creatives` loads
- no obvious UI regression was introduced
- reviewer smoke still passes

Live-sample note:

- the current visible live sample did not expose a `Test More` row during the runtime probe
- the positive fatigue-caveat render case therefore remains confirmed by deterministic surface and prescription tests, not by the live browser sample

## Outcome

Pass-6 hardening is complete.

The fatigue caveat no longer misfires from missing frequency data, and the work remains ready for one final Claude product review.
