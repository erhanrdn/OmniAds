# PR Review Cleanup Audit

Generated: 2026-04-26T21:11:23Z

This audit covers PR #81 and its active dependencies. PRs remain Draft. No merge
or main push was performed.

## 1. PR #81 Current HEAD Commit

PR #81 code head before this audit-only documentation update:

- `8d04d358a4e8f0695468052321e9835b7fc6130e`

The final pushed branch head after this audit file is recorded in the PR #81
body because a commit cannot reliably contain its own final SHA.

## 2. PR #78 Dependency Commit

- PR: #78
- Branch: `wip/creative-decision-os-v2-baseline-first-2026-04-26`
- Dependency commit: `3da2e05cb47f97de89ee42d9af6a64598af8b17a`

## 3. PR #79 Contract v0.1.1 Dependency Commit

- PR: #79
- Branch: `review/creative-v2-operator-surface-contract-2026-04-26`
- Dependency commit: `d0c326d3051510df74a7ef063bbd3e93d127a8f2`
- Contract JSON:
  `docs/operator-policy/creative-segmentation-recovery/reports/v2-operator-surface-contract-2026-04-26/surface-contract-v0.1.1.json`

## 4. GitHub Checks Status

GitHub API check-run summary:

| PR | Head | Required local jobs | Deprecated infra checks | Active blocker |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #78 | `3da2e05` | build/test/typecheck success | legacy deploy checks skipped; legacy external suite queued | no |
| #79 | `d0c326d` | build/test/typecheck success | legacy deploy checks skipped; legacy external suite queued | no |
| #80 | `9d2c582` | build/test/typecheck success | legacy deploy checks skipped; legacy external suite queued | no |
| #81 | `8d04d35` | build/test/typecheck success | legacy deploy checks skipped; legacy external suite queued | no |

Infrastructure update: the active runtime is now the self-hosted site and
self-hosted PostgreSQL database. Vercel and Neon references are deprecated
infrastructure and must not be treated as active merge-readiness blockers.

The queued external app suites and skipped deploy/runtime jobs shown on #78-#81
are tracked here as deprecated-infrastructure artifacts only. They are not
active product blockers for PR #81. Any future active deployment/runtime check
should be named and evaluated against the self-hosted server environment.

## 5. GitHub Files-View Warning Status

GitHub files view inspection:

- PR #79 files view: no active hidden/bidirectional warning text found.
- PR #81 files view: hidden/bidirectional warning text still appears in the
  unauthenticated GitHub files view on multiple active diff sections.

Active PR #81 files-view warnings observed:

Exact warning text:

```text
This file contains hidden or bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.
```

| PR | File | GitHub files-view line/context | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #81 | `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.test.tsx` | lines 318-327 | Not fixed in code; no active codepoint found |
| #81 | `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.tsx` | lines 369-379 | Not fixed in code; no active hidden codepoint found |
| #81 | `app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.test.ts` | lines 469-478 | Not fixed in code; no active hidden codepoint found |
| #81 | `app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.ts` | lines 542-551 | Not fixed in code; no active hidden codepoint found |

The PR #81 unauthenticated files page loaded only the first part of the diff and
then showed a GitHub page-load error. Active raw blobs, PR diff, and PR patch
were scanned separately.

## 6. Hidden/Bidi Warning Status

Active blob and patch scans:

| Target | Result |
| --- | --- |
| PR #79 active raw blobs | no hidden/bidi/control findings |
| PR #79 `.diff` | no hidden/bidi/control findings |
| PR #79 `.patch` | no hidden/bidi/control findings |
| PR #81 active raw blobs | no hidden/bidi/control findings |
| PR #81 `.diff` | no hidden/bidi/control findings |
| PR #81 `.patch` | no hidden/bidi/control findings |

Exact active scan behavior:

- Hidden/control ranges scanned:
  `U+0000-U+0008`, `U+000B`, `U+000C`, `U+000E-U+001F`, `U+007F`,
  `U+202A-U+202E`, `U+2066-U+2069`.
- PR #81 active raw blobs scanned: 10 changed files.
- PR #79 active raw blobs scanned: 3 changed files.

Historical/stale GitHub conversation warnings:

| PR | Location | Context | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #79 | Conversation page lines 273-279 | Historical commit `895016d` | Historical/stale; active files and raw blobs are clean |
| #81 | Conversation page lines 278-284 | Historical commit `735765d` | Historical/stale; active raw blobs and patch are clean |

The PR #81 files view still displays active UI warning banners even though no
hidden/bidi/control codepoint was found in active raw blobs, `.diff`, or
`.patch`. This is not ignored; it remains a documented GitHub UI warning that
must be reviewed before any merge decision.

## 7. Codex PR Review Comments Status

Inspection method:

- GitHub connector `_list_pull_request_review_threads`
- GitHub connector `_fetch_pr_comments`
- GitHub connector `_list_pull_request_reviews`
- PRs inspected: #78, #79, #80, #81
- Local `gh auth status`: unavailable because the GitHub CLI is not logged in.

Result:

| PR | Review threads | Timeline comments/reviews | Review submissions |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| #78 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| #79 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| #80 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| #81 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

No Codex PR Review comment was found through the connector surfaces. There was
therefore no actionable review thread to resolve through the connector.

## 8. Unresolved Review Threads Status

GitHub connector review-thread result:

- PR #78: 0 review threads.
- PR #79: 0 review threads.
- PR #80: 0 review threads.
- PR #81: 0 review threads.

No unresolved review thread was found.

## 9. Security/Secret/Raw-Data Scan Status

Local scans were run against the PR #81 changed source/report scope:

- restricted filename scan: passed.
- secret/raw-data pattern scan: passed.
- no environment files are included.
- no raw private screenshots are included.
- report artifacts use sanitized row aliases and sanitized screen notes.

## 10. Formatting/Readability Scan Status

Local formatting/readability checks:

- `git diff --check`: passed.
- line-length/readability check: passed.
- hidden/bidi/control scan: passed.
- strict non-ASCII diff scan: passed.
- v2 preview readability test: passed.

The new report files are multiline Markdown, not generated one-line files.

## Infrastructure Reference Audit

Supervisor infrastructure update applied:

- Active site runtime: self-hosted server.
- Active database runtime: self-hosted PostgreSQL database.
- Deprecated infrastructure names must not be treated as active blockers.
- Generic `DATABASE_URL` requirements remain valid because the self-hosted DB
  still needs a configured PostgreSQL connection string.

PR #81 report updates:

- `FOR_CHATGPT_REVIEW.md`: standard DB connection wording kept, with no
  provider-specific assumption.
- `authenticated-preview-screen-notes.md`: self-hosted DB wording retained.
- `PR_REVIEW_CLEANUP_AUDIT.md`: legacy deploy/check wording reclassified as
  deprecated infrastructure, not active blockers.
- `OPERATOR_SESSION_CHECKLIST.md`: not present in this branch/worktree.

Repository reference scan:

| Path | Reference | Classification | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `lib/db.ts` | `DATABASE_URL` | active generic DB connection | keep |
| `scripts/*seed*`, `scripts/check-google-reset.mjs` | `DATABASE_URL` | active generic DB connection | keep |
| `lib/meta/*`, `lib/google-ads/*`, `lib/sync/runtime-contract.ts` | `DATABASE_URL` | active generic DB/runtime checks | keep |
| `.github/workflows/db-normalization-second-window.yml` | remote `.env.production` `DATABASE_URL` | self-hosted workflow-style DB lookup | keep |
| `app/api/db-test/route.ts` | legacy provider name in comment | legacy wording leftover | list only; no code change in PR #81 |
| `lib/media-cache/cache-repository.ts` | legacy provider name in comment | legacy wording leftover | list only; no code change in PR #81 |
| `docs/hetzner-migration.md` | legacy provider migration note | historical doc | list only |
| `docs/architecture/serving-runtime-validation-evidence.md` | old provider-specific validation note | historical doc | list only |
| `docs/self-hosted-db-ops.md` | self-hosted DB without deprecated provider | current self-hosted doc | keep |

No product code or deployment workflow was changed in this audit branch. The
legacy provider wording above should be cleaned separately if ChatGPT requests a
repo-wide infrastructure documentation cleanup.

## 11. Remaining Warnings

Remaining documented warnings:

1. PR #81 GitHub files-view hidden/bidirectional warning banners still appear in
   the unauthenticated files UI, despite clean active raw/diff/patch scans.
2. PR #79 and PR #81 conversation pages still show historical hidden/bidi
   warning banners from older commits.
3. The authenticated demo workspace has no direct-actionability row, so visual
   proof of review-only Scale/high-spend Cut ranking above direct Protect/Test
   More is fixture-backed, not workspace-rendered.

Deprecated-infrastructure notes, not active blockers:

- Legacy external deployment suites appear queued through the GitHub checks API.
- Legacy deploy/runtime GitHub Actions jobs are skipped on #78-#81.
- These are not active blockers because the active infrastructure is the
  self-hosted server and self-hosted database.

## Pre-Merge Hard Gate Still Open

Limited read-only preview is allowed. Merge is not allowed.

Before any merge decision, every active warning must be fixed or explicitly
closed with evidence:

- GitHub/Codex PR Review warnings remain tracked.
- Hidden/bidirectional Unicode GitHub UI warnings remain tracked.
- Security, secret, and raw-data warnings remain tracked.
- Formatting and readability warnings remain tracked.
- Unresolved review threads remain tracked.
- Suspicious active self-hosted runtime/deployment checks remain tracked.
- Any active self-hosted DB/live-preview validation blocker remains tracked.

Deprecated infrastructure is not an active blocker:

- Vercel and Neon are deprecated infrastructure.
- Vercel queued/skipped checks must not be listed as active blockers.
- Neon-specific DB assumptions must be removed or marked legacy.
- Active deployment/runtime validation should refer to the self-hosted server
  and self-hosted PostgreSQL database only.

No warning is being ignored silently. Visible GitHub UI warnings and review
items remain documented in this audit until fixed or explicitly closed with
evidence.

## 12. Remaining Warning Detail

- PR #79, conversation historical commit `895016d`, web text lines 273-279:
  hidden/bidirectional Unicode warning. Not changed in code because active files
  view and raw/diff/patch scans are clean. Classified as historical/stale.
- PR #81, conversation historical commit `735765d`, web text lines 278-284:
  hidden/bidirectional Unicode warning. Not changed in code because active
  raw/diff/patch scans are clean. Warning remains visible in conversation.
- PR #81, `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.test.tsx`, GitHub files view lines
  318-327: hidden/bidirectional Unicode warning. Active raw blob and PR patch
  have no matching hidden/bidi/control codepoint.
- PR #81, `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.tsx`, GitHub files view lines
  369-379: hidden/bidirectional Unicode warning. Active raw blob and PR patch
  have no matching hidden/bidi/control codepoint.
- PR #81, `app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.test.ts`, GitHub
  files view lines 469-478: hidden/bidirectional Unicode warning. Active raw
  blob and PR patch have no matching hidden/bidi/control codepoint.
- PR #81, `app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.ts`, GitHub files
  view lines 542-551: hidden/bidirectional Unicode warning. Active raw blob and
  PR patch have no matching hidden/bidi/control codepoint.
- PR #78-#81, GitHub checks: legacy external deploy suite queued. Not fixed in
  PR #81 because it is deprecated infrastructure, not an active blocker.
- PR #78-#81, GitHub Actions deploy/runtime jobs: completed with conclusion
  `skipped`. Not fixed in PR #81 because this is a deprecated deploy/runtime
  path, not an active blocker.
- PR #81, authenticated preview evidence: no direct-actionability row was
  present in the demo workspace. This is not a code fix; fixture-backed sorting
  tests remain the evidence for limited preview.

## 13. No Silent Warning Ignoring

No warning is being ignored silently.
