Public GitHub API showed PR #78, #79, #80, and #81 are open Draft PRs.

# PR #80 / Claude Review Pointer Status

Public branch inspection found these Claude review branches:

- `review/creative-v2-completed-operator-session-buyer-review-2026-04-27`
- `review/creative-v2-ui-iteration-buyer-review-2026-04-27`
- `review/creative-v2-second-session-buyer-review-2026-04-27`

Public GitHub API did not show Draft PRs for those review branches. Local `gh`
is not authenticated, so Codex did not create PRs and did not ask for a token.
PR #81 report files now include direct pointers to these review branches.


# Targeted Hidden/Bidi Exception Proof After ChatGPT Rejection

This is not a generic closure report and does not claim merge-readiness. It is
a targeted file-by-file exception packet for the active GitHub warning banners
reported on PR #81.

Active PR evidence used:

- Active PR #81 branch: `wip/creative-v2-readonly-ui-preview-2026-04-26`.
- PR #81 public API head before this report-only commit:
  `029a612bdd9bde6b7315e33cac6aa10bebe75828`.
- PR #81 commits page showed the formatting commit
  `0ab332ee739e14c00b5c07abb1728741b5e520a0` with message
  `chore: format creative v2 active source files`.
- PR #81 commits page showed the raw-verification commit
  `029a612bdd9bde6b7315e33cac6aa10bebe75828` with message
  `docs: record creative v2 raw url verification`.
- Public GitHub files HTML still contained hidden/bidirectional warning template
  sections for:
  - `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.test.tsx`
  - `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.tsx`
  - `app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.test.ts`
- ChatGPT also reported `app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.ts`;
  the targeted raw scan below includes that file too.

Exact scan commands used for each public raw file:

```bash
curl -LfsS "$RAW_URL" -o /tmp/pr81-warning-file.txt
wc -l < /tmp/pr81-warning-file.txt
awk 'length($0)>220 {print FNR ":" length($0)}'   /tmp/pr81-warning-file.txt
perl -ne 'print "$ARGV:$.:$_" if   /[\x00-\x08\x0B\x0C\x0E-\x1F\x7F\x{202A}-\x{202E}\x{2066}-\x{2069}]/'   /tmp/pr81-warning-file.txt
node <non-ascii-codepoint-counter> /tmp/pr81-warning-file.txt
git diff -U0 origin/wip/creative-decision-os-v2-baseline-first-2026-04-26...HEAD --   "$FILE" | perl -ne 'print if /^[+-](?![+-])/' |   perl -ne 'print if /[^\x00-\x7F]/'
```

File-by-file results:

`app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.test.tsx`:

- Public raw lines: 297.
- Lines greater than 220 characters: none.
- Hidden/bidi/control scan result: 0 matches.
- Non-ASCII result: none.
- PR #81 introduced non-ASCII: no.
- GitHub files warning status: warning template still present in public files
  HTML.

`app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.tsx`:

- Public raw lines: 1267.
- Lines greater than 220 characters: none.
- Hidden/bidi/control scan result: 0 matches.
- Non-ASCII result: normal Turkish UI punctuation/codepoints only:
  - U+00F6 (\u00F6)
  - U+00FC (\u00FC)
  - U+0131 (\u0131)
  - U+011F (\u011F)
  - U+00E7 (\u00E7)
  - U+015F (\u015F)
  - U+00D6 (\u00D6)
  - U+00B7 (\u00B7)
- PR #81 introduced non-ASCII: no. Base comparison and zero-context non-ASCII
  diff produced no output.
- GitHub files warning status: warning template still present in public files
  HTML.

`app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.test.ts`:

- Public raw lines: 66.
- Lines greater than 220 characters: none.
- Hidden/bidi/control scan result: 0 matches.
- Non-ASCII result: none.
- PR #81 introduced non-ASCII: no. The file is new in PR #81 but contains no
  non-ASCII and no hidden/bidi/control codepoints.
- GitHub files warning status: warning template still present in public files
  HTML.

`app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.ts`:

- Public raw lines: 120.
- Lines greater than 220 characters: none.
- Hidden/bidi/control scan result: 0 matches.
- Non-ASCII result: none.
- PR #81 introduced non-ASCII: no. The file is new in PR #81 but contains no
  non-ASCII and no hidden/bidi/control codepoints.
- GitHub files warning status: not found in the public files HTML
  warning-template list during this verification, but included because ChatGPT
  reported it.

For the normal Turkish UI characters in `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.tsx`,
base-branch comparison found the same non-ASCII character set and the exact
zero-context diff command above produced no non-ASCII added or removed lines.
These characters are visible letters/punctuation, not zero-width, bidi, or
control codepoints.

Conclusion:

- Product-ready: NO.
- Merge-ready: NO.
- Human merge consideration into PR #78: NO until ChatGPT accepts this exact
  file-level exception evidence or the GitHub files-view warning banners
  disappear.
- No false-positive closure is claimed here.

# Active source formatting correction after ChatGPT rejection

ChatGPT rejected the previous PR #81 state because the active branch still
appeared to have a single-line `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.test.tsx`, dense
generated-looking TSX in
`components/creatives/CreativeDecisionOsV2PreviewSurface.tsx`, and an active
GitHub files-view hidden/bidirectional warning.

Formatting correction applied in this update:

- Ran a Prettier formatting pass with LF line endings and retained changes on:
  - `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.test.tsx`
  - `components/creatives/CreativeDecisionOsV2PreviewSurface.tsx`
  - `app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.ts`
  - `lib/creative-decision-os-v2-preview.ts`
  - `lib/creative-decision-os-v2-preview.test.tsx`
  - `src/services/data-service-ai.ts`
- Inspected `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.tsx`; it was left unchanged
  because formatting existing Turkish UI text would create non-ASCII churn in
  this file-hygiene patch.
- Inspected `app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.test.ts`; the
  formatter left it unchanged.
- Strengthened the readability test so active preview TS/TSX/JS/JSX files fail
  if they have suspiciously low line count for their byte size or any line
  exceeds 200 characters.
- No resolver thresholds, gold labels, v1 behavior, queue/apply behavior,
  Command Center wiring, DB writes, Meta/platform writes, or product semantics
  changed.

Local raw file readability after the formatting correction:

| File | Lines | Max line |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.test.tsx` | 298 | 99 |
| `components/creatives/CreativeDecisionOsV2PreviewSurface.tsx` | 625 | 111 |
| `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.tsx` | 1268 | 196 |
| `app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.ts` | 121 | 100 |
| `app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.test.ts` | 67 | 109 |
| `lib/creative-decision-os-v2-preview.ts` | 663 | 100 |
| `lib/creative-decision-os-v2-preview.test.tsx` | 394 | 137 |
| `src/services/data-service-ai.ts` | 446 | 100 |

Current validation before push:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Focused Creative/v2 preview tests | passed, 6 files, 40 tests |
| `npm test` | passed, 305 files, 2193 tests |

- No exact raw file line or codepoint was found for those warning template
  sections.

Product-ready: NO. Merge-ready: NO. Active raw formatting is corrected and the
exact public raw URLs show real line breaks, but hidden/bidi files-view closure
is not claimed because GitHub files HTML still contains warning template
sections and no exact line/codepoint can be documented from raw files.

# Superseded prior GitHub evidence correction after ChatGPT review

ChatGPT review found a contradiction between the prior closure packet and
active GitHub evidence. The prior packet said hidden/bidi and
line-length/readability concerns were closed, but the GitHub files view was
reported to still warn on `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.test.tsx`, and active
raw files were reported as too dense or collapsed.

Correction in this update:

- `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.test.tsx` was reformatted so the active test
  file has a fresh readable multi-line source diff.
- `components/creatives/CreativeDecisionOsV2PreviewSurface.tsx` was reformatted
  to split dense TSX and repeated class strings into readable multi-line code.
- `lib/creative-decision-os-v2-preview.test.tsx` now includes a hygiene test
  that fails when active preview TS/TSX/JS/JSX files collapse into suspiciously
  few lines or contain generated-looking huge lines.
- The listed related files were inspected for line count and max line length.
  No resolver thresholds, gold labels, v1 behavior, queue/apply behavior,
  Command Center wiring, DB writes, Meta/platform writes, or product semantics
  were changed.

Readable source metrics after the formatting correction:

| File | Lines | Max line |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.test.tsx` | 294 | 108 |
| `components/creatives/CreativeDecisionOsV2PreviewSurface.tsx` | 595 | 118 |
| `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.tsx` | 1268 | 196 |
| `app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.ts` | 119 | 105 |
| `app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.test.ts` | 67 | 109 |
| `lib/creative-decision-os-v2-preview.ts` | 651 | 133 |
| `lib/creative-decision-os-v2-preview.test.tsx` | 366 | 137 |
| `src/services/data-service-ai.ts` | 437 | 114 |

The earlier false-positive closure is withdrawn until the active GitHub files
view is checked after this formatting correction is pushed. If the GitHub
warning remains, it must be handled at exact active file level rather than
closed through broad diff/patch evidence alone.

Post-push public GitHub evidence for formatting correction commit
`cb9eb9b155da250822fb27aeff1cf8274eaaa55f`:

- At capture time, PR #81 public API head was `cb9eb9b155da250822fb27aeff1cf8274eaaa55f`.
- PR #81 is still Draft.
- Public GitHub files HTML still contains hidden/bidirectional warning banners.
- The warning banners are attached to these active file sections:
  - `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.test.tsx`
  - `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.tsx`
  - `app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.test.ts`
  - `app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.ts`
- Public raw targeted scans for those files found zero hidden/bidi/control
  codepoints.
- Public raw source files are multi-line and readable after formatting:
  - `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.test.tsx`: 294 lines, max line 108.
  - `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.tsx`: 1268 lines, max line 196.
  - `app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.test.ts`: 67 lines, max
    line 109.
  - `app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.ts`: 119 lines, max line
    105.
  - `components/creatives/CreativeDecisionOsV2PreviewSurface.tsx`: 595 lines,
    max line 118, no banner found in public files HTML.
- Public PR #81 `.diff` and `.patch` scans found zero hidden/bidi/control
  codepoints.

Conclusion: this prior evidence is superseded by the latest active source formatting correction above. M1/M2 remain open and are not closed by exception.

# Hidden / Bidi Warning Status

GitHub UI banner state could not be inspected directly because local `gh` is
not authenticated and browser automation does not have GitHub UI auth.

Evidence collected without secrets:

- Public GitHub `.diff` and `.patch` scans for PR #78, #79, #80, and #81 found
  zero hidden, bidi, or control codepoints.
- Local modified-file hidden/bidi/control scan found zero matches.
- Strict non-ASCII scan on added/removed diff lines found zero matches.

Historical warning status for PR #79 and PR #81:

- Active public `.diff` and `.patch` artifacts for PR #79 found zero hidden,
  bidi, or control codepoints.
- Active public `.diff` and `.patch` artifacts for PR #81 found zero hidden,
  bidi, or control codepoints.
- If GitHub still shows a warning banner, broad diff/patch evidence is not
  enough to close it. The exact active file and available line/context must be
  checked after this formatting correction.

Current status:

- M1 hidden/bidi active warning status:
  `open_active_github_files_view_warning_remains_after_formatting`.
- M2 historical PR #79/#81 hidden/bidi warning status:
  `open_active_github_files_view_warning_remains_after_formatting`.

This is not silently ignored. Broad local and public diff/patch scans remain
important evidence, but they are not enough to close the warning while an
active GitHub files-view banner is reported. After this formatting correction
is pushed, the exact active files must be rechecked. If the banner is gone,
M1/M2 can close normally. If the banner remains, the exact file and line context
must be documented, or the inability to reproduce it must be recorded without
claiming closure.

# Review Threads and GitHub Comments

Public GitHub API results:

Local `gh auth status` reports no authenticated GitHub host. Codex did not ask
the supervisor for a GitHub token.

Closure:

- M5 review threads status: `closed_by_public_api_evidence`.
- Caveat: no hidden private GitHub UI state was inspected.
- No actionable public review thread exists.

# Vitest Clean-Checkout Repeatability

Status: passed.

Verification commands:

```bash
git worktree add /private/tmp/adsecute-v2-clean-checkout-34Y2bW HEAD
cd /private/tmp/adsecute-v2-clean-checkout-34Y2bW
npm ci
npx vitest run lib/creative-decision-os-v2-preview.test.tsx \
  app/'(dashboard)'/creatives/page.test.tsx \
  app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.test.ts
```

Result:

- `npm ci`: completed successfully. NPM printed the existing audit advisory
  summary, but package-audit triage was not part of this PR scope.
- Focused clean-checkout tests: passed, 3 files, 16 tests.

# Security / Secret / Raw-Data Scan Status

Local scans on modified and report files:

- Restricted filename scan: passed.
- Secret/raw-ID scan: passed.
- No env files, auth credentials, tokens, DB URLs, server credentials, raw
  account names, raw creative names, raw campaign names, or private screenshots
  were committed.

# Formatting / Readability Status

- `git diff --check`: passed.
- Line-length/readability scan: passed before the ChatGPT correction, but the
  prior closure was too broad because active source files still appeared
  compressed in GitHub evidence.
- This update reformats the active source/test files listed above and adds a
  code hygiene test to prevent one-line or generated-looking TS/TSX output.
- Second-session reports were rewritten as normal Markdown sections with normal
  line breaks. They are not generated one-line Markdown blobs.

# Forbidden Rendered Term Status

Covered by `lib/creative-decision-os-v2-preview.test.tsx` and focused
Creative/v2 preview tests.

Closure:

- M6 contract parity / forbidden-term hard gate status: closed as a manual hard
  gate, not automated CI.
- Merge is not allowed unless `npm test` and the focused Creative/v2 preview
  tests pass.

Forbidden action terms remain blocked in rendered preview output:

- Apply
- Queue
- Push
- Auto
- Scale now
- Cut now
- Approve
- Product-ready
- Direct scale

# Internal Artifact Rendered Term Status

Covered by `lib/creative-decision-os-v2-preview.test.tsx` and focused
Creative/v2 preview tests.

Internal artifact terms remain blocked in rendered preview output:

- gold
- fixture
- PR
- ChatGPT
- Claude
- Codex
- WIP
- internal evaluation
- labels this row

# Self-Hosted Runtime Validation Status

Full authenticated DOM validation after lane polish was completed through a
short supervisor-assisted natural-language runtime validation.

Accepted evidence still stands:

- Supervisor used the existing authenticated self-hosted OmniAds site. Domain
  intentionally not recorded.
- Lane separation is much better.
- Ready for Buyer Confirmation and Diagnose are distinct.
- No Apply / Queue / Push / Auto / Scale now / Cut now / Approve button was
  seen.
- No unsafe action language, internal artifact language, or write behavior was
  reported.

Closure:

- M3 full post-polish authenticated DOM validation status: closed.
- Non-blocking visual note: when Ready for Buyer Confirmation is empty and
  Buyer Review contains many cards, the vertical balance can still look
  awkward. This is future polish, not a safety blocker.

# Direct-Actionability Evidence Status

Authenticated workspace direct-actionability row: absent.

Current supporting evidence:

- Deterministic component/model test verifies review-only Scale and high-spend
  Cut rank above direct Protect/Test More rows.

This remains a product-ready tracking item. It does not block continued limited
read-only preview.

# Diagnose Investigate No-Op Status

Closure:

- M7 Diagnose `Investigate` no-op status: closed.
- Evidence: no clickable `Investigate` no-op is rendered; focused test coverage
  remains active.

# Explicit Non-Ignoring Statement

No blocker is being silently ignored.

The prior hidden/bidi false-positive exception is no longer treated as closed.
After formatting, public raw files are clean and readable, but the public
GitHub files HTML still shows active warning banners on the files listed above.
The items that could not be inspected because `gh` is unauthenticated or
authenticated private GitHub UI state is unavailable are documented as
limitations. Limited read-only preview may continue. PR #81 is not
product-ready, not merge-ready, and not ready for human merge consideration
into the PR #78 branch while the active GitHub warning remains open.
