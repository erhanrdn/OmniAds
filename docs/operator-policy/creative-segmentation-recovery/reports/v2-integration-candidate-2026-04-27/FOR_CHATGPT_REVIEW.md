# Executive Summary

Codex created a separate Draft/WIP integration candidate branch because direct
merge of PR #81 into the PR #78 branch was not the safest path from this
environment. The blocker is not code merge risk; PR #81 is stacked directly on
PR #78 and merged cleanly. The blocker is that Codex cannot independently run a
fresh authenticated self-hosted runtime smoke without asking for forbidden
domain, token, browser session, server, or database details.

The integration candidate combines the PR #78 resolver branch and the PR #81
read-only UI preview branch. It does not touch main and does not request main
merge. The branch remains WIP/Draft material only.

Product-ready: NO.

Merge-ready to main: NO.

Queue/apply: disabled.

Command Center: disconnected.

v1: default.

v2 preview: off by default.

Self-hosted site/DB: active infra.

Vercel/Neon: deprecated.

PR remains Draft.

No main push.

# Consolidation Method

PR #81 was not merged directly into the PR #78 branch. Codex created a new
integration candidate branch based on PR #78 and merged PR #81 into it with a
no-fast-forward merge.

This branch is a replacement candidate for direct PR #81 to PR #78 merge
consideration. It preserves the Draft/WIP state and avoids mutating the PR #78
branch before the remaining gates are reviewed.

# Gold-v0.1 Resolver Score

Post-consolidation v2 gold eval:

| Field | Result |
| --- | --- |
| artifactVersion | `gold-v0.1` |
| rowCount | 78 |
| macroF1 | 97.96 |
| severe mismatches | 0 |
| high mismatches | 0 |
| medium mismatches | 2 |
| low mismatches | 0 |
| queueEligibleCount | 0 |
| applyEligibleCount | 0 |
| directScaleCount | 0 |
| inactiveDirectScaleCount | 0 |

# Live-Audit Status

The resolver live audit evidence from PR #78 remains included. The sanitized
audit covered 8 businesses, 9 accounts, and 303 creative rows. It reported zero
queue-eligible rows, zero apply-eligible rows, zero direct Scale rows, and zero
inactive direct Scale rows.

Codex did not rerun the live audit in this integration step because that would
require the self-hosted database tunnel/runtime details that must not be
requested or exposed.

# Read-Only UI Preview Status

The PR #81 read-only preview remains behind the query-param preview gate. v1
remains default, and the v2 preview remains off by default. The preview includes
Today Priority, Scale-ready copy, Buyer Review, Ready for Buyer Confirmation,
Diagnose First, and Inactive Review lanes.

No resolver thresholds, gold labels, v1 behavior, queue/apply behavior, Command
Center wiring, DB write path, or Meta/platform write path was changed by this
consolidation.

# Operator Session Summary

The first supervised limited read-only operator session was conducted and
recorded. Sanitized accepted results:

- First-glance clarity: about 85 percent.
- Top rows noticed first: spend-heavy loss-making rows.
- Cut clarity: positive.
- Refresh clarity: positive.
- Inactive rows: clearly separated.
- Unsafe action language: not reported.
- Internal artifact language: not reported.
- Write behavior: not reported.
- Direct-actionability row: absent in the authenticated workspace.

# Second Delta-Validation Summary

The second validation was intentionally a post-iteration delta validation, not a
full repeated operator session. The previous full session remains the baseline.

Accepted delta results:

- Scale-ready copy no longer creates a blocking hesitation.
- Diagnose no longer reads as an action queue.
- The old clickable no-op Investigate affordance is no longer visible.
- Ready for Buyer Confirmation is understandable and separate from Diagnose.
- Lane separation is much better.
- Remaining visual note: when Ready for Buyer Confirmation is empty and Buyer
  Review has many cards, vertical balance can still look awkward. This is not a
  safety blocker for limited read-only preview.

# Hidden/Bidi Exception Acceptance Scope

ChatGPT accepted the targeted hidden/bidi exception only for human merge
consideration of PR #81 into the PR #78 stacked dependency branch. The exception
is not product-ready clearance and not main-merge clearance.

File-level proof from `bc9624e` and Claude review:

| File | Public raw lines | Long lines >220 | Hidden/bidi/control | Non-ASCII |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.test.tsx` | 297 | 0 | 0 | none |
| `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.tsx` | 1267 | 0 | 0 | normal Turkish UI codepoints only, pre-existing in base |
| `app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.test.ts` | 66 | 0 | 0 | none |
| `app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.ts` | 120 | 0 | 0 | none |

The visible GitHub warning is documented as a narrow GitHub UI heuristic /
template exception for PR #78-branch WIP consideration only. It is not silently
ignored.

# GitHub/Codex Review Warning Status

Public GitHub API evidence for PR #78, #79, #80, and #81:

| PR | Reviews | Review comments | Issue comments |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| #78 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| #79 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| #80 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| #81 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

No GitHub token was requested. No authenticated private review-thread state was
inspected. If an authenticated GitHub UI later shows unresolved private threads,
those remain active blockers.

# Test/Typecheck/Build Results

# Self-Hosted Runtime Smoke Result

Post-consolidation authenticated self-hosted runtime smoke was not performed by
Codex. The environment available to Codex did not contain an authenticated
self-hosted browser state that could be used without asking for prohibited
domain, token, browser session, server, database, or credential details.

This is documented as a blocker, not faked. Prior authenticated validation from
PR #81 remains useful evidence, but it is not a fresh post-consolidation runtime
smoke.

# Forbidden Text/Internal Artifact Scan Result

Focused Creative/v2 preview tests cover forbidden rendered button/action text
and internal artifact wording. They passed before and after consolidation.

The manual scan over changed files found zero hidden/bidi/control codepoints,
zero restricted filenames, and no secret values.

# Queue/Apply/Command Center/Write Safety Status

- Queue/apply remains disabled.
- Command Center remains disconnected.
- v1 remains default.
- v2 preview remains off by default.
- No DB writes from v2 preview interactions were added.
- No Meta/platform writes were added.
- No unsafe action language was added.

# Remaining Merge-to-Main Blockers

- Fresh authenticated self-hosted runtime smoke after consolidation.
- Network-level no-write enforcement for the v2 preview endpoint and
  detail/open interactions.
- Automated CI wiring for forbidden-term and contract-parity gates.
- Authenticated review-thread inspection if public API evidence is insufficient
  for the merge owner.
- Continued treatment of GitHub warning banners as active gates unless the
  documented exception remains explicitly accepted by the merge owner.

# Remaining Product-Ready Blockers

- Third full supervised operator session unless ChatGPT later waives it.
- Workspace-rendered direct-actionability evidence or stronger deterministic
  substitute accepted by ChatGPT.
- Network-level no-write enforcement.
- Automated CI wiring for the forbidden-term and contract-parity hard gate.
- Diagnose volume and product framing review.
- Buyer confirmation lane validation on a workspace with direct rows.
- Final senior media buyer blind/read-only review.
- Vertical-balance polish for the empty confirmation lane plus many Buyer
  Review cards.

# Recommendation

Keep Draft. Continue limited read-only preview as supervised evidence gathering
only. Request the next ChatGPT decision on whether to open or review this
integration candidate branch as the replacement for direct PR #81 to PR #78
merge consideration.
