PR #81 is still based directly on PR #78. The merge-base between the PR #78
branch and the PR #81 branch is `3da2e05cb47f97de89ee42d9af6a64598af8b17a`,
which is the current PR #78 head.

# Merge Strategy Used

Codex did not update the PR #78 branch directly. A separate integration
candidate branch was created from PR #78, then PR #81 was merged into it with:

```bash
git checkout -B wip/creative-decision-os-v2-integration-candidate-2026-04-27 \
  origin/wip/creative-decision-os-v2-baseline-first-2026-04-26

git merge --no-ff origin/wip/creative-v2-readonly-ui-preview-2026-04-26 \
  -m "merge: integrate creative v2 read-only preview candidate"
```

Reason for integration branch instead of direct PR #78 mutation:

- Code merge was clean.
- Authenticated self-hosted runtime smoke could not be independently rerun from
  this shell without asking for prohibited domain, token, session, server, or DB
  details.
- The integration branch preserves Draft/WIP review without mutating PR #78.

# Conflicts

No merge conflicts occurred.

# Files Changed By Consolidation

The merge brought in the PR #81 changed files relative to PR #78:

- `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.test.tsx`
- `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.tsx`
- `app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.test.ts`
- `app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.ts`
- `components/creatives/CreativeDecisionOsV2PreviewSurface.tsx`
- `lib/creative-decision-os-v2-preview.test.tsx`
- `lib/creative-decision-os-v2-preview.ts`
- `src/services/data-service-ai.ts`
- PR #81 report files under
  `docs/operator-policy/creative-segmentation-recovery/reports/`

This audit then adds only the integration-candidate report packet under:

`docs/operator-policy/creative-segmentation-recovery/reports/v2-integration-candidate-2026-04-27/`.

# Behavior Change Beyond Combining PR #78 and PR #81

No behavior changed beyond combining the existing PR #78 resolver work and PR
#81 read-only preview work. The report packet is documentation only.

No resolver thresholds changed. No gold labels changed. v1 behavior was not
changed. Queue/apply was not enabled. Command Center was not wired. No DB write
or Meta/platform write path was added.

# Exact Commands Run

Pre-consolidation on PR #81:

```bash
git fetch --prune origin
git rev-parse HEAD
git merge-base origin/wip/creative-decision-os-v2-baseline-first-2026-04-26 \
  origin/wip/creative-v2-readonly-ui-preview-2026-04-26
git diff --check
npm test
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run build
npx vitest run lib/creative-decision-os-v2.test.ts \

# PR Body Update Status

`gh auth status` reported that the local GitHub CLI is not logged in. Codex did
not ask the supervisor for a token and did not run `gh auth login`.

Because authenticated GitHub write access was unavailable, Codex could not open
the Draft PR or update PR #78/#81 bodies from this environment. The branch and
repo reports are the handoff artifacts.

# GitHub Auth Limitation Status

Public GitHub API reads were available and used for PR metadata and public
comment/review counts. Authenticated private review-thread state was not
inspected.

If the merge owner sees unresolved threads in an authenticated GitHub UI, those
threads remain active blockers.
