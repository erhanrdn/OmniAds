# PR #65 Main Release Evidence - 2026-04-28

Scope:

- Integrated PR #65 media-buyer scoring into the current main release path.
- Preserved the PR #74 fatigued high-spend below-baseline Cut behavior inside the new scorecard path.
- Restored Creative v2 buyer preview visibility on the default Creative page, with explicit query opt-out only.
- Reviewed open Creative PRs for runtime/UI work. PR #65 was the only open non-draft runtime merge candidate; older draft/review PRs are evidence or helper history and must not be wholesale applied over the current v2 UI.
- Google Ads and sync/control-plane work were intentionally excluded from this release scope.
