# Limited Operator Preview Result

This is the sanitized report for the supervised limited read-only operator
preview session for PR #81. It is report-only. No product code, resolver logic,
v1 behavior, UI behavior, queue/apply behavior, Command Center wiring, database
write path, or Meta/platform write path was changed by this session update.

Session actually conducted: YES.

Session environment type: self-hosted authenticated internal/dev workspace.

Runtime confirmation:

- Site runtime: local app session pointed at the self-hosted runtime path.
- Database runtime: self-hosted PostgreSQL reached through the approved local
  tunnel path.
- Connection strings, cookies, tokens, raw account names, raw creative names,
  browser session state, server details, and credentials are omitted.
- Vercel and Neon are deprecated infrastructure and are not treated as active
  blockers.
- Active runtime validation refers to the self-hosted server and self-hosted
  PostgreSQL database only.

# URLs Used

Normal no-flag page:

- `http://localhost:3000/creatives`

V2 preview page:

- `http://localhost:3000/creatives?creativeDecisionOsV2Preview=1`

The local worktree environment file was restored without printing secret values.
The local DB tunnel and app server were verified before the session continued.

# Normal No-Flag Result

| Field | Sanitized result |
| --- | --- |
| no_flag_v2_preview_visible | false |
| no_flag_v1_normal | true |
| no_flag_notes | No v2 preview visible; no abnormal normal-page behavior reported. |

Result: PASS for the off-by-default gate.

# V2 Flag Result

| Field | Sanitized result |
| --- | --- |
| with_flag_v2_preview_visible | true |
| with_flag_v1_still_visible | not explicitly re-confirmed by operator |
| today_priority_visible | supported by technical baseline; not separately asked as a raw checklist item |
| diagnose_collapsed_by_default | supported by technical baseline; live operator interacted with Diagnose |
| inactive_review_collapsed_or_muted | supported by technical baseline; operator said inactive rows were clear |
| with_flag_notes | Preview visible and understandable; buyer UX hesitations recorded below. |

Result: PASS for preview visibility, with buyer UX issues recorded below.

Additional operator notes:

- `Scale-worthy` showing zero caused interpretation hesitation.
- Diagnose may be interpreted as a confirmation/review area.

# Operator 5-Second Answer

Sanitized operator answer: mostly yes.

The supervisor estimated first-glance clarity at about 85%. This means the page
communicates today's focus, but still carries some interpretation friction.

# Top Rows Noticed First

Sanitized answer: spend-heavy loss-making rows.

The operator would inspect rows that appear to be burning spend or losing money
first. No raw creative, account, campaign, or ad set names were recorded.

# Rows Causing Hesitation

No row-level hesitation was reported.

Hesitations recorded:

- `Scale-worthy` shows zero even though the supervisor believes at least one
  creative appears scale-worthy.
- Diagnose `Investigate` was visible but did not perform an observable action.
- Direct-actionability / confirmation meaning was not clearly distinguished
  from Diagnose.

# Scale Candidate Clarity

Scale clarity is not sufficient yet.

The supervisor believes a scale candidate exists, but the panel summary shows
`Scale-worthy` as zero. This is a buyer UX mismatch and should be treated as a
UI/copy/resolver-explanation iteration item. It is not a product-ready result.

# Cut Candidate Clarity

Cut candidate clarity: positive.

The supervisor saw at least one cut candidate. No raw creative name was
recorded.

# Refresh Candidate Clarity

Refresh candidate clarity: positive.

The supervisor saw at least one refresh candidate. No raw creative name was
recorded.

# Diagnose Usefulness / Dominance

Diagnose needs UI iteration.

The operator reported that the `Investigate` control inside Diagnose appeared
but did not work in an observable way. This was recorded as a usability issue,
not as unsafe write behavior.

# Inactive Review Clarity

Inactive Review clarity: positive.

The supervisor reported inactive/passive creatives are separated clearly.

# Button / Copy Safety

Supervisor reported no unsafe action language.

Forbidden action language not seen:

- Apply
- Queue
- Push
- Auto
- Scale now
- Cut now
- Approve

Prior technical validation also found zero forbidden action terms and zero
internal artifact terms in the rendered preview.

# Write-Safety

| Write surface | Result |
| --- | --- |
| V2 preview DB writes | 0 observed in prior technical validation; not directly observable by supervisor |
| V2 preview Meta/platform writes | 0 observed in prior technical validation; not directly observable by supervisor |
| Command Center/work-item writes | 0 observed in prior technical validation |
| Queue/apply writes | 0 observed in prior technical validation |

The supervisor did not see any control that felt like a live write, queue,
apply, push, approval, or platform mutation.

# Direct-Actionability Row Presence

Direct-actionability row present in this workspace: NO.

The authenticated technical baseline had zero direct-actionability rows. During
the live session, a separate direct-actionability / buyer-confirmation row was
not clearly observed. The supervisor interpreted Diagnose as possibly serving a
similar purpose, which is a section-meaning clarity issue rather than ranking
evidence.

Visual proof that review-only Scale or high-spend Cut ranks above direct
Protect/Test More is therefore still fixture-backed, not workspace-rendered.
Keep this as a merge/product-readiness tracking item.

# Blocking Hesitations

Blocking for product readiness:

- Scale candidate mismatch: operator sees a possible scale candidate while
  `Scale-worthy` shows zero.
- Diagnose `Investigate` control appears interactive but does not perform an
  observable action.
- Direct-actionability / confirmation meaning is not clearly separated from
  Diagnose in the operator's mental model.

These are not blockers for continuing the limited read-only preview, but they
are blockers for product-ready, accepted, approved, or merge-ready claims.

# Continue Limited Preview?

Limited preview should continue: YES, only as supervised read-only preview
evidence gathering.

Do not merge. Do not replace v1. Do not enable queue/apply. Do not wire Command
Center. Do not add DB writes, Meta writes, or platform writes. Do not describe
the preview as product-ready, accepted, approved, or merge-ready.

# UI Iteration Needed?

UI iteration needed: YES.

Required follow-up themes:

- Explain or relabel `Scale-worthy = 0` so a media buyer understands why a
  perceived scale candidate is not counted.
- Make Diagnose `Investigate` either open useful read-only context or remove
  the interactive affordance.
- Clarify Diagnose versus buyer confirmation / direct-actionability meaning.

# Product-Code Confirmation

No product code changed in this session update.

# Draft / Merge Confirmation

- PR remains Draft.
- Merge is not requested.
- Main was not pushed.

# Infrastructure Confirmation

- Vercel and Neon are deprecated infrastructure.
- Vercel queued/skipped checks are not active product blockers.
- Neon-specific DB wording is legacy and not active DB infrastructure.
- Active runtime validation refers to the self-hosted server and self-hosted
  PostgreSQL database only.
- Generic configured database connection requirements remain valid for live
  audit and preview validation.
