# Pointer

The senior Meta media buyer review of Codex's narrow active-source
formatting correction packet on PR #81 has been pushed as a standalone
branch and a single primary report file. The local `gh` CLI is not
authenticated in this environment and no `GH_TOKEN` /
`GITHUB_TOKEN` is exported, so a Draft PR could not be opened from
here.

This file is a pointer only. The full review is at the
`PRIMARY_REPORT_PATH` on the standalone branch.

# Verdict summary

- Verdict: MERGE_READINESS_STILL_BLOCKED.
- Product-ready: NO.
- Merge-ready to main: NO.
- Merge-ready for human consideration into the PR #78 stacked
  dependency branch: NO.
- Queue/apply safe: NO.
- Buyer confidence score: 84/100 (up from 83).

# What changed

Code (`0ab332e`):

- Broader formatting pass across 8 active source/test files. Style
  normalisation only; no functional behavior change.
- Component still has only the existing row-card onOpenRow button;
  no new write paths.
- Independently verified file metrics:

| File | Lines | Max line |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.test.tsx` | 296 | 99 |
| `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.tsx` | 1266 | 196 |
| `app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.test.ts` | 65 | 109 |
| `app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.ts` | 119 | 100 |
| `components/creatives/CreativeDecisionOsV2PreviewSurface.tsx` | 623 | 111 |
| `lib/creative-decision-os-v2-preview.ts` | 661 | 100 |
| `lib/creative-decision-os-v2-preview.test.tsx` | 392 | 137 |
| `src/services/data-service-ai.ts` | 444 | 100 |

Documentation (`41a9d80`):

- Recorded post-push public GitHub evidence at PR #81 head `0ab332e`.
- Banner narrowed from 4 files to 3:
  - Cleared:
    `app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.ts`
  - Still flagged:
    `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.test.tsx`,
    `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.tsx`,
    `app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.test.ts`
- Raw active blob, `.diff`, and `.patch` scans report zero
  hidden/bidi/control codepoints across all PR #81 files.
- No exact raw file line or codepoint documented for the three
  remaining banner sections.
- False-positive exception remains withdrawn. Reports do not
  re-introduce it.

# Notable progress signal

The formatting correction *demonstrably* cleared the banner on one
file. That makes the "GitHub UI heuristic, not a real codepoint"
narrative more defensible than at the prior HEAD, but three persistent
banners without per-line trigger evidence are not yet enough to ask a
merge owner to accept the publicly visible warning.

# Remaining blockers

Pre-merge for human consideration into the PR #78 stacked dependency
branch:

- M1/M2: Active GitHub files-view hidden/bidi banner persists on
  three documented files. Either banner clears on follow-up recheck,
  or supervisor-captured authenticated GitHub UI session records
  exact post-formatting line ranges and any character ranges GitHub
  highlights, or owner-level adjudication with concrete trigger
  evidence is recorded.

Pre-merge to main (additional, unchanged):

- M5: Authenticated GraphQL inspection of unresolved review-thread
  state.
- M6 (CI wiring): Contract parity / forbidden-term scan must fail
  the merge gate automatically in CI.
- M3 extension: Mechanical authenticated DOM scan with
  `data-testid` assertions plus network-level write-request capture.

Product-ready (unchanged):

- P1-P7 carry forward.

# Recommended next step

Do not merge PR #81 into the PR #78 stacked dependency branch yet.
Keep PR #81 Draft. Continue limited read-only preview as supervised
evidence gathering. Drive M1/M2 to closure via:

1. Recheck the GitHub files-view banner after a brief delay.
2. If persistent, ask the supervisor (authenticated browser session)
   to capture exact post-formatting line ranges GitHub highlights on
   each of the three files plus any character ranges or
   bidirectionality the UI annotates inline; identify the trigger
   character if possible and normalize/replace it; otherwise record
   the screenshot + line ranges + raw-file content as concrete
   owner-visible evidence and request adjudication.
3. Do not re-introduce the prior false-positive exception silently.

# Confirmations

- This pointer changed no product code, resolver logic, gold labels,
  fixtures, v1 behavior, UI behavior, queue/apply, Command Center
  wiring, DB writes, or Meta/platform writes.
- This pointer did not merge, did not push to main, did not enable
  queue/apply, did not wire Command Center, and did not introduce any
  write behavior.
- All artifacts cited use sanitized row aliases.
- Active runtime validation refers to the self-hosted server and
  self-hosted PostgreSQL database only.
