# Pointer

The senior Meta media buyer adjudication review of Codex's PR #81
hidden/bidi state at HEAD `41a9d80` has been pushed as a standalone
branch and a single primary report file. The local `gh` CLI is not
authenticated in this environment and no `GH_TOKEN` /
`GITHUB_TOKEN` is exported, so a Draft PR could not be opened from
here.

This file is a pointer only. The full review is at the
`PRIMARY_REPORT_PATH` on the standalone branch.

# Verdict summary

- Verdict: DOCUMENTED_EXCEPTION_REVIEW_REQUIRED.
- Product-ready: NO.
- Merge-ready to main: NO.
- Merge-ready for human consideration into the PR #78 stacked
  dependency Draft branch: conditional on the merge owner accepting
  the documented exception with the recorded guardrails. The buyer
  cannot grant this; the merge owner must.
- Queue/apply safe: NO.
- Buyer confidence score: 85/100 (up from 84).

# Independently verified state

- PR #81 head: `41a9d8030de6ef770f64088a98225791cdd5e51b`. Draft.
- `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.test.tsx`: 297 lines.
- `components/creatives/CreativeDecisionOsV2PreviewSurface.tsx`: 624
  lines.
- Component still has only the row-card `<button>` wired to
  `onOpenRow`. No new write paths.
- Banner section list at this HEAD: three files (page.test.tsx,
  page.tsx, route.test.ts). `route.ts` cleared between `cb9eb9b` and
  `0ab332e`.
- Public raw blob, `.diff`, `.patch`, and strict non-ASCII diff scans
  all report zero hidden/bidi/control codepoints.

# Senior buyer adjudication recommendation

The evidence base has shifted firmly toward "GitHub diff-view /
heuristic / template false-positive". The route.ts banner movement
after a whitespace-only formatting reformat is concrete evidence that
the warning is responsive to file shape, not to hidden content. The
four-surface zero-findings scan evidence corroborates this.

But the buyer cannot unilaterally grant the exception. The merge owner
must conduct an explicit documented-exception adjudication, scoped
narrowly to human merge consideration into the PR #78 stacked
dependency Draft branch only.

# Required guardrails for the documented exception

- Exception scope is *only* human merge consideration into the PR #78
  stacked dependency Draft branch. Not main. Not undrafting.
- Merge owner must explicitly acknowledge in writing the persistent
  banner on the three named files at the recorded HEAD SHA.
- Merge owner must accept the four-surface zero-findings scan
  evidence and the route.ts banner-movement evidence as the basis for
  the exception.
- PR #81 stays Draft after the merge into the PR #78 branch.
- Merge to main is *not* approved by the exception. M5, M6, and M3
  extension remain required for any future main-merge consideration.
- Product-ready remains NO under all conditions of this exception.
- Merge owner must run `npm test` plus the focused Creative/v2
  preview vitest run on their machine and verify pass before merging.

# Remaining blockers

Pre-merge for human consideration into the PR #78 stacked dependency
Draft branch:

- M1/M2: documented-exception adjudication by the merge owner with
  the guardrails above.

Pre-merge to main (additional, unchanged):

- M5: Authenticated GraphQL inspection of unresolved review-thread
  state.
- M6 (CI wiring): Contract parity / forbidden-term scan must fail
  the merge gate automatically in CI.
- M3 extension: Mechanical authenticated DOM scan with `data-testid`
  assertions plus network-level write-request capture.

Product-ready (unchanged):

- P1-P7 carry forward.

# Recommended next step

Send the closure packet plus the full review to the merge owner and
ask for an explicit documented-exception adjudication with the
guardrails recorded.

If accepted, the merge owner may proceed to merge PR #81 into the
PR #78 stacked dependency Draft branch, keep PR #81 Draft, and continue
limited read-only preview as supervised evidence gathering.

If declined, PR #81 stays Draft-only on its own branch and the team
should consider whether to invest more cycles in identifying a per-line
trigger or to wait for a different signal.

# Confirmations

- This pointer changed no product code, resolver logic, gold labels,
  fixtures, v1 behavior, UI behavior, queue/apply, Command Center
  wiring, DB writes, or Meta/platform writes.
- This pointer did not merge, did not push to main, did not enable
  queue/apply, did not wire Command Center, and did not introduce any
  write behavior.
- This pointer does not unilaterally grant a merge exception.
- All artifacts cited use sanitized row aliases.
- Active runtime validation refers to the self-hosted server and
  self-hosted PostgreSQL database only.
