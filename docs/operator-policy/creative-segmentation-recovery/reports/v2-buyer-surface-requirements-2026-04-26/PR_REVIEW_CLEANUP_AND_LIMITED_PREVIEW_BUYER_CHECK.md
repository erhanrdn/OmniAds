## Verdict: PASS WITH MONITORING - LIMITED READ-ONLY OPERATOR PREVIEW SESSION IS SAFE

The pre-merge warning cleanup is genuinely complete or honestly deferred for every item ChatGPT enumerated. The GitHub UI hidden/bidi warning is a definitively explained false positive (Turkish UI strings on `page.tsx` that pre-date this PR by months; the three NEW files have zero non-ASCII bytes). The second authenticated preview session re-confirmed the surface renders correctly, v1 is preserved, no forbidden language is rendered, and zero v2 detail-click writes hit the app. No Codex PR Review comment exists on any of the four PRs. The single non-blocking observation (no direct-actionability row in the demo workspace) is honestly tracked. Limited read-only operator preview session with the supervisor/user is safe to allow under the existing off-by-default flag and the existing safety contract. **No merge.** **No queue/apply.** **No platform writes.** **No product-ready claim.**

## 1. Are all Codex / GitHub review warnings resolved or explicitly documented?

**Yes.** Codex enumerated every warning class ChatGPT listed and either fixed it or explicitly classified it as historical/external/non-active with the exact reason.

| Warning class | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Codex PR Review comments on #78/#79/#80/#81 | none exist | GitHub connector `_list_pull_request_review_threads` / `_fetch_pr_comments` / `_list_pull_request_reviews` returned 0 across all 4 PRs |
| Unresolved review threads | none exist | same connector result, 0 across all 4 PRs |
| GitHub Actions deploy/runtime jobs | `skipped` | pre-existing workflow behavior; not introduced by PR #81; documented as pre-merge warning in the cleanup audit |
| Vercel suite | `queued` | pre-existing external check integration; not introduced by PR #81; documented as pre-merge warning |
| GitHub files-view hidden/bidi banner on 4 PR #81 files | active scans clean; UI banner explained below | independently re-verified in section 2 of this addendum |
| Conversation-page hidden/bidi banner on PR #79/#81 | historical/stale | tied to historical commits `895016d` (PR #79) and `735765d` (PR #81); active raw blob, `.diff`, `.patch` are clean |
| Security/secret/raw-data scan | clean | restricted-filename, secret-pattern, raw-name scans all pass |
| Formatting/readability scan | clean | `git diff --check`, line-length check, v2 preview readability test all pass |
| Type/build/test warnings | none | npm test 305 files / 2186 tests pass; tsc clean; build clean; focused 6 files / 33 tests pass |
| Gold eval | macro F1 97.96; severe 0; high 0; medium 2; low 0 | unchanged from prior round; no regression |

No warning class is being silently ignored. Every documented item has a concrete reason and a concrete classification.

## 2. Are hidden/bidi warnings genuinely gone or correctly classified as stale/historical?

**Definitively classified.** I ran a broader hidden-character scan than Codex's (added U+200B-U+200F zero-width range, U+2060-U+2064, U+FEFF BOM, U+E0001 / U+E0020-U+E007F tag block, U+00A0 NBSP, U+00AD soft hyphen, U+180E, full Latin-1 supplement control range U+0080-U+009F, plus an unrestricted "any non-ASCII byte" pass) on each of the 4 active blob files Codex listed.

Result for each file on the PR #81 head blob:

| File | Total bytes | Non-ASCII chars | Hidden/bidi/control chars | New in PR #81? |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.test.tsx` | 9,177 | **0** | 0 | yes (new file) |
| `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.tsx` | 53,973 | 73 | 0 | **NO - pre-existing on origin/main** |
| `app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.test.ts` | 2,476 | **0** | 0 | yes (new file) |
| `app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.ts` | 3,732 | **0** | 0 | yes (new file) |

The 73 non-ASCII characters in `page.tsx` are entirely Turkish UI strings:

```
U+0131 ı x36   U+011F ğ x10   U+00E7 ç x8    U+015F ş x6
U+00F6 ö x5    U+00FC ü x5    U+00B7 · x2    U+00D6 Ö x1
```

Independently verified: the same 73 characters with the same per-codepoint counts are present in `origin/main:app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.tsx`. PR #81 did not introduce them; they pre-date this PR.

**Conclusion on hidden/bidi UI warning:** false positive in GitHub's files-view UI heuristic. The 4 new files (`page.test.tsx`, `route.test.ts`, `route.ts`) have **zero** non-ASCII bytes. The pre-existing `page.tsx` carries Turkish Latin-Extended letters that some GitHub UI views appear to flag conservatively, but no character in any of the 4 files falls in any documented hidden, bidirectional, or control codepoint range. PR #81 introduces zero new codepoints that could trigger the warning. Treating this as historical/stale UI rendering is correct  -  and now with character-level evidence rather than just clean-scan assertion.

If GitHub's banner heuristic continues to alarm operators, the most surgical mitigation (in a separate doc-only follow-up, not blocking limited preview) would be to localize the Turkish strings into the existing language file or convert them to ASCII via the existing translation layer. That is a polish item, not a security or correctness item, and it is **not** the scope of PR #81.

## 3. Does the authenticated limited preview still answer the 5-second buyer questions?

**Yes.** Second authenticated session against the same demo workspace produced a separate set of DOM assertions (`authenticated-preview-screen-notes.md` updated as part of `a210598`):

**No-flag baseline confirmed clean:**
- v1 Creative page visible: yes
- `[data-testid="creative-v2-preview-surface"]` count: **0** (preview off)
- Forbidden language visible: 0
- Internal artifact terms visible: 0
- App write requests during no-flag check: 0

**With-flag preview confirmed clean:**
- v1 still visible: yes (not replaced)
- Preview surface count: 1
- Today Priority visible with Scale, Cut, AND Refresh mentioned: yes
- Diagnose section present and collapsed by default: yes
- Inactive Review present and collapsed by default: yes
- Forbidden language visible: 0
- Internal artifact terms visible: 0
- Safe read-only buttons visible: 6
- App write requests before detail-click: 0
- App write requests during v2 detail-click: 0

**Preview payload:** endpoint returned 200 with 8 rows, 3 in Today Priority, 0 direct rows. The 5-second tile model (Bleeding spend / Scale-worthy / Fatiguing on budget / Leave alone / Needs diagnosis) is preserved structurally and renders against this workspace's smaller cohort.

## 4. Is the page safe enough for limited read-only operator preview?

**Yes**  -  under the existing safety contract. The safety guarantees that gate this answer:

1. **Off by default.** No-flag baseline (re-verified) renders zero v2 surface and zero v2 endpoint writes.
2. **Query-param gate only.** Two parameters (`creativeDecisionOsV2Preview=1`, `v2Preview=1`) enable the preview. No env var, no session flag, no DB feature flag  -  the gate is removable by URL editing.
3. **v1 is the source of truth.** The v2 preview reads the latest v1 snapshot; it does not write a new snapshot, does not feed Command Center, does not generate work items.
4. **No write paths.** Endpoint is read-only. Detail-click captures zero app write requests in two consecutive authenticated sessions.
5. **No queue/apply UI controls.** queueEligible / applyEligible always false. `lib/creative-decision-os-v2.ts` invariant preserved.
6. **No forbidden button/text.** Three-layer guard (source grep, runtime regex parity test newly added in `289a9b0`, rendered DOM assertion). All three pass.
7. **No internal-artifact wording.** Same three-layer guard.
8. **v1 is the production default.** v2 preview is a separate component (`CreativeDecisionOsV2PreviewSurface.tsx`); the existing `CreativeDecisionSupportSurface` is untouched.

These eight guarantees collectively make a supervisor-led limited preview session a safe operation. The only side effect of an enabled preview session is on the operator's screen.

## 5. Are there any remaining buyer hesitations?

Three honest tracking items, none of which block a limited read-only preview session:

**5a. Direct-actionability rendering remains fixture-tested only.** The demo workspace had no direct rows in either authenticated session. Visual proof of "review_only Scale and high-spend Cut sort above direct Protect/Test More" remains the fixture-backed library test. A future authenticated session against a workspace that does contain a direct row (or a deliberately seeded preview cohort) would close this loop. Honest disclosure preserved in the updated screen notes.

**5b. GitHub UI files-view banner on the four flagged files.** Now definitively explained at the codepoint level (section 2 above): false positive triggered by pre-existing Turkish UI strings on `page.tsx`; the three new files contribute zero non-ASCII bytes. Operationally not a defect; UX cleanup item only.

**5c. Vercel queued / GitHub Actions deploy-jobs skipped.** External check integrations not introduced by PR #81. Documented in the cleanup audit. Pre-existing repository state. Not a PR #81 defect.

None of these three are in the resolver, the contract, the surface logic, or the safety gates. They are observability or seeding items that can be tracked outside the limited-preview session.

## 6. Is any warning being ignored silently?

**No.** Every warning, including the historical/stale ones, is explicitly enumerated in `PR_REVIEW_CLEANUP_AUDIT.md` sections 11 and 12 with PR number, file, line, exact warning text, fixed/not-fixed status, and reason. The cleanup audit explicitly states "No warning is being ignored silently" in section 13. I independently verified the four hidden/bidi entries with a broader scan than the audit used and confirmed Codex's classification is correct (and stronger than Codex articulated, because the only non-ASCII content is pre-existing Turkish UI text on a file PR #81 did not introduce).

## 7. Should ChatGPT allow a limited read-only operator preview session with the supervisor/user?

**Yes  -  within the read-only contract already in place.** Permitted scope:

- The supervisor or one designated operator opens the Creative page with the v2 preview flag enabled in a controlled session.
- They navigate the surface, click Open detail / View diagnosis / See blocker / Compare evidence as documented.
- They confirm the surface answers the 5-second buyer questions and that no forbidden language appears.
- They report observations back. No code change, no write, no Meta call, no Command Center wiring, no queue/apply enablement results from the session.

Not permitted in this session:

- Any merge action on PR #78 / PR #79 / PR #80 / PR #81.
- Any push to main.
- Any apply / queue / push / launch button click  -  none should exist anyway.
- Any platform write to Meta.
- Any product-ready or accepted claim.
- Any change to v1 default behavior.

Recommended follow-up after the session (separate PRs, not blocking):

- Localize the Turkish strings on `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.tsx` to remove the GitHub UI banner for future PRs (cosmetic).
- Seed a workspace with at least one direct-actionability row to close the visual sort-order proof gap noted in 5a.
- Continue tracking the Vercel queued / GH Actions skipped items as the existing repository's external-integration polish.

## Confirmation

- I did not modify any product code.
- I did not modify any resolver logic.
- I did not modify any gold labels.
- I did not modify any PR #78 / PR #79 / PR #81 files. I only read them and wrote this addendum on the PR #80 branch.
- I did not propose any unsafe queue/apply behavior.
- I did not inspect raw private data. The character-level scan in section 2 is over UTF-8 codepoints in source files, not over private workspace data.
- This addendum lives under the PR #80 reviewer directory because PR #80 carries the buyer requirements that PR #81 was reviewed against.
- I am not requesting merge of any PR.
- I am not making a product-ready / accepted / approved claim.
