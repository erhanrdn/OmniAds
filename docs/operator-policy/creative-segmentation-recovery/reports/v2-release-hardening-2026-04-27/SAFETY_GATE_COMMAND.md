# Safety Gate Scope

The gate runs these focused Vitest files:

```text
lib/creative-decision-os-v2.test.ts
lib/creative-decision-os-v2-preview.test.tsx
lib/creative-v2-no-write-enforcement.test.ts
lib/get-route-side-effect-guard.test.ts
src/services/data-service-ai.test.ts
components/creatives/CreativeDecisionSupportSurface.test.tsx
components/creatives/CreativesTableSection.test.tsx
app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.test.tsx
app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.test.ts
```

The gate then evaluates the v2 gold artifact and fails on:

```text
macroF1 below 90
severe mismatches above 0
high mismatches above 0
Watch primary outputs above 0
Scale Review primary outputs above 0
queue eligible outputs above 0
apply eligible outputs above 0
direct Scale outputs above 0
inactive direct Scale outputs above 0
```

# Latest Result

`npm run creative:v2:safety` passed:

```text
