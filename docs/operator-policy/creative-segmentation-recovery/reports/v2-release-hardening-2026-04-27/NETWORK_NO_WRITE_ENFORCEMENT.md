# Network-Level No-Write Enforcement

CHATGPT_REVIEW_READY: YES
SANITIZED: YES

# Summary

This pass keeps focused no-write enforcement around the v2 preview route,
client fetch path, preview UI model/component, and row detail/open path.

Result: passed locally through `npm run creative:v2:safety`.

# Test Files

| Test file | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| `app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.test.ts` | endpoint off-by-default and flag-gated GET behavior |
| `src/services/data-service-ai.test.ts` | client preview fetch remains GET-only with no body |
| `lib/creative-v2-no-write-enforcement.test.ts` | static and route-scanner no-write boundary assertions |
| `lib/creative-decision-os-v2-preview.test.tsx` | preview component/model read-only checks |
| `app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.test.tsx` | page keeps v2 preview off by default and query gated |

# Mocked Or Scanned Write Boundaries

Boundaries covered by tests/scans:

- HTTP POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE from the v2 client preview fetch path.
- Next route handlers other than GET on
  `/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview`.
- Command Center modules and execution/apply boundaries.
- work-item/work item wording or wiring in the v2 preview path.
- queue/apply command creation.
- Meta/platform write client imports.
- DB mutation patterns, SQL write keywords, and known route side-effect targets.
- Preview row detail/open path calling fetch, mutation, Command Center, or
  run-analysis functions.

# Exact Assertions

The tests assert:

- `GET /api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview` stays read-only.
- The endpoint exports no POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE handlers.
- The client service calls only GET, uses no request body, and uses no-store.
- Opening a v2 row only calls the existing local drawer path.
- Diagnose/detail/open UI surfaces do not call network or mutation boundaries.
- No Command Center work item is created.
- No queue/apply command is created.
- No Meta/platform write client is called.
- No DB mutation service is called from the v2 preview path.

# Commands

Primary hardening command:

```bash
npm run creative:v2:safety
```

Focused no-write-only command:

```bash
npx vitest run \
  lib/creative-v2-no-write-enforcement.test.ts \
  src/services/data-service-ai.test.ts \
  app/api/creatives/decision-os-v2/preview/route.test.ts
```

# Result

Local result:

- `npm run creative:v2:safety`: passed.
- Focused safety test run inside that command: 9 files passed, 51 tests passed.

# Raw Formatting Correction

The no-write enforcement test was reformatted with Prettier in commit
`73bdee0806a703886d1b98b29b9a4eb9e3d42896`.

Local evidence:

```text
$ wc -l lib/creative-v2-no-write-enforcement.test.ts
     156 lib/creative-v2-no-write-enforcement.test.ts
$ awk 'length($0)>220 {print FNR ":" length($0)}' lib/creative-v2-no-write-enforcement.test.ts

$ python3 -c '...'
lib/creative-v2-no-write-enforcement.test.ts LF 156 CR 0 bytes 5430
```

Public Raw evidence:

  | awk 'length($0)>220 {print FNR ":" length($0)}'
```

The public Raw `awk` check produced no output. The file is readable multi-line
TypeScript with real LF newlines.

# Remaining Limit

These are deterministic code and unit-level network/write boundary checks. A
fresh authenticated self-hosted browser smoke with network capture remains open
because Codex did not have authenticated self-hosted browser state and did not
ask for prohibited secrets or domain details.
