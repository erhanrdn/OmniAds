## Working Tree

`git status --short --branch` showed:

```text
## feature/adsecute-decision-range-firewall...origin/feature/adsecute-decision-range-firewall
?? docs/operator-policy/phase-3/
```

The untracked path is the Phase 3 completion report directory. This pass did not modify app code.

## Local Checks Recorded

These checks were recently run by the orchestrator and recorded for this QA pass:

- `npm test -- lib/operator-decision-metadata.test.ts lib/command-center.test.ts lib/command-center-execution-service.test.ts app/api/meta/decision-os/route.test.ts app/api/meta/recommendations/route.test.ts app/api/creatives/decision-os/route.test.ts lib/meta/decision-os.test.ts lib/creative-decision-os.test.ts components/meta/meta-decision-os.test.tsx components/creatives/CreativeDecisionOsOverview.test.tsx`
  - Result: passed, 10 files / 72 tests

- `npx tsc --noEmit`
  - Result: passed
- `git diff --check`
  - Result: passed

  - Result: no lint script exists
