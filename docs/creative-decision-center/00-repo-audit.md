# Creative Decision Center V2.1 Repo Audit

Generated from repo inspection and spike runs on 2026-04-30. This pass did not change runtime behavior.

## Baseline Health

| Check | Command | Result | Creative Decision Center relevance |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Package manager | `package-lock.json`, `package.json` | npm | No pnpm/yarn/bun lock present. |
| Full unit suite | `npm test` | 309 files / 2257 tests passed | Baseline green. |
| Creative focused tests | `npx vitest run lib/creative-decision-os.test.ts ...` | 9 files / 216 tests passed | Current V1/V2/operator coverage is healthy. |
| V2 safety gate | `npm run creative:v2:safety` | passed | 78 gold rows, macro F1 97.96, 0 severe/high mismatches, queue/apply all false. |
| V2.1 spike artifact guard | `npx vitest run scripts/creative-decision-center-v21-spike.test.ts` | 1 file / 3 tests passed | Verifies generated golden cases, no row-level `brief_variation`, and explicit live-read status. |
| Self-hosted smoke | `npm run creative:v2:self-hosted-smoke` | failed preflight | Missing `CREATIVE_V2_SMOKE_BASE_URL`; not a code failure. |
| Lint | n/a | no package script | Do not invent command. |
| Typecheck | n/a | no package script | Do not invent command. |

Missing coverage for V2.1:

| Gap | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Buyer adapter tests | UI should render `buyerAction`, not infer from V1/operator labels. |
| Data readiness tests | `fix_delivery`, `fix_policy`, `watch_launch` are unsafe without proof fields. |
| Aggregate decision tests | `brief_variation` must not leak into row-level actions. |
| Read-time old snapshot adapter tests | Old V1/operator snapshots must remain renderable. |
| Before/after conflict tests | Scale vs cut conflicts need an explicit gate before rollout. |

## Hard Unknowns

| Unknown | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Live DB snapshot availability | `DATABASE_URL` is not set in shell; generated spike says no live read attempted. |
| Actual production coverage for status/policy/24h fields | Current public row contracts do not expose enough fields. |
| Whether DB tables already store effective/review status | Fetcher requests `effective_status` filter but row mapper/type do not expose it. |
| Whether old snapshots can all adapt cleanly | Need read-only snapshot sample from DB. |
