# CODex Phase Review Packet

## 1. Identity
- Phase: `V4-03 — Creative Media Truth & Decision-First Review`
- Date: `2026-04-12`
- Implementation commit: `8c38576d9e4aee831af36d8082f3250f8168c550`
- Baseline live SHA at review start: `9addb96bedfbaf5067584418c1c3e139543f92fd`

## 2. Scope Delivered
- Added honest preview review states: `ready`, `metrics_only_degraded`, `missing`.
- Promoted the primary creative decision into the table row itself.
- Reworked the detail surface so preview truth, queue state, blockers, and AI gating are explicit.
- Shifted the drawer/overview wording from `Recommendations` to `Operator Review`.

## 3. Architecture Changes
- Preview truth and queue semantics in [lib/creative-decision-os.ts](/Users/harmelek/Adsecute/lib/creative-decision-os.ts) and [lib/creative-decision-os-source.ts](/Users/harmelek/Adsecute/lib/creative-decision-os-source.ts).
- Overview/drawer changes in [components/creatives/CreativeDecisionOsOverview.tsx](/Users/harmelek/Adsecute/components/creatives/CreativeDecisionOsOverview.tsx) and [components/creatives/CreativeDecisionOsDrawer.tsx](/Users/harmelek/Adsecute/components/creatives/CreativeDecisionOsDrawer.tsx).
- Table/detail changes in [components/creatives/CreativesTableSection.tsx](/Users/harmelek/Adsecute/components/creatives/CreativesTableSection.tsx) and [components/creatives/CreativeDetailExperience.tsx](/Users/harmelek/Adsecute/components/creatives/CreativeDetailExperience.tsx).
- Creative presets in [app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.tsx](/Users/harmelek/Adsecute/app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.tsx).

## 4. Acceptance Checklist
- Phase closure verdict: `shipped-not-complete`
- Real-account browser evidence captured: `no`
- Reason: this session did not obtain a safe strong-account browser login beyond the demo reviewer path.
- Benchmark evidence captured at deploy boundary: `no`
- Reason: creative truth evidence came from live DB/runtime and local smoke only; no production cutover to `8c38576...` was observed.

## 5. Test Evidence
- `npx vitest run components/creatives/CreativeDecisionOsOverview.test.tsx lib/creative-decision-os.test.ts app/api/creatives/decision-os/route.test.ts`
- `npm test` -> `201 passed`
- `npm run test:smoke:local` -> `4 passed`, `1 skipped`
- Local reviewer smoke accepted the new AI gating flow by handling both enabled and disabled commentary states.

## 6. Live Smoke Evidence
- Grandmix: `creative_daily` ready through `2026-04-03`.
- IwaStore: `creative_daily` ready through `2026-04-03`.
- TheSwaf: both provider accounts had `creative_daily` `completedDays: 0` and no `readyThroughDate`.
- These benchmark results match the V4 degraded-preview stance: the system must stay honest when media truth is incomplete.

## 7. Deployment And Rollout
- Creative review changes were pushed in `8c38576...`.
- The old live SHA remained active during observation, so browser-based live V4 creative review could not be captured.
- Local smoke nevertheless produced updated reviewer and commercial artifacts under `test-results/`.

## 8. Known Risks
- Real-business creative browser proof remains missing.
- TheSwaf still has a hard creative readiness gap in warehouse truth.
- Local smoke recovered from session token collision retries; auth setup is still noisier than ideal.

## 9. Exact Review Request For GPT
- Review the creative detail and table surfaces for overconfident wording when preview truth is degraded.
- Focus on whether AI interpretation can leak into states where preview truth or shared authority should keep it disabled.

## 10. Copy-Paste Quick Summary
- V4-03 is implemented and locally verified. Creative review now exposes honest preview truth, first-class decisions, and AI gating, but live production did not cut over to the V4 SHA during this session.
