# CODex Phase Review Packet

## 1. Identity
- Phase: `V4-05 — Operator Compression, Archetype Views & Launch Readiness`
- Date: `2026-04-12`
- Implementation commit: `8c38576d9e4aee831af36d8082f3250f8168c550`
- Baseline live SHA at review start: `9addb96bedfbaf5067584418c1c3e139543f92fd`

## 2. Scope Delivered
- Added persisted operator presets for Meta and Creative.
- Reduced card/chip duplication by elevating top actions, truth caps, blockers, and queue state.
- Updated smoke expectations to the V4 operator wording and queue semantics.
- Collected benchmark DB/runtime evidence and local smoke artifacts for launch review.

## 3. Architecture Changes
- Preset store in [store/preferences-store.ts](/Users/harmelek/Adsecute/store/preferences-store.ts).
- Preset selectors in [app/(dashboard)/platforms/meta/page.tsx](/Users/harmelek/Adsecute/app/(dashboard)/platforms/meta/page.tsx) and [app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.tsx](/Users/harmelek/Adsecute/app/(dashboard)/creatives/page.tsx).
- Updated reviewer smoke contract in [playwright/tests/reviewer-smoke.spec.ts](/Users/harmelek/Adsecute/playwright/tests/reviewer-smoke.spec.ts).
- Updated canonical authority copy in [docs/v3-01-release-authority.md](/Users/harmelek/Adsecute/docs/v3-01-release-authority.md) and [docs/meta-page-ui-contract.md](/Users/harmelek/Adsecute/docs/meta-page-ui-contract.md).

## 4. Acceptance Checklist
- Phase closure verdict: `shipped-not-complete`
- Real-account browser evidence captured: `no`
- Reason: no strong real-account browser session was available beyond local/demo smoke.
- Benchmark evidence captured at deploy boundary: `no`
- Reason: benchmark evidence was captured locally, but production never reported build `8c38576...`.

## 5. Test Evidence
- `npx tsc --noEmit`
- `npm test` -> `201 passed`
- `npm run test:smoke:local` -> `4 passed`, `1 skipped`
- `node --import tsx scripts/verify-release-authority.ts --mode=preflight` -> `pass`

## 6. Live Smoke Evidence
- `npm run test:smoke:live` against current production: `3 passed`, `1 failed`, `1 skipped`.
- Failure detail: reviewer smoke expected `Action Context` but production still rendered legacy `Recommendations`.
- `node --import tsx scripts/verify-release-authority.ts --mode=post_deploy --base-url=https://adsecute.com --expected-build-id=9addb96...` failed as expected because repo docs are now ahead of the still-old live release authority payload.

## 7. Deployment And Rollout
- Repo rollout status: `main` now contains `8c38576...`.
- Production rollout status during this session: still on `9addb96...`.
- Worktree was clean after the implementation push.
- Final launch readiness remains blocked on production cutover and post-cutover smoke.

## 8. Known Risks
- Exact-SHA production rollout for V4 was not observed.
- Reviewer/auth setup still logs session token collisions during local smoke.
- Real-account browser proof remains the main non-code gap.

## 9. Exact Review Request For GPT
- Review the preset system and compression pass for hidden regressions in discoverability.
- Focus on whether any critical blocker or guardrail can disappear under non-default presets.

## 10. Copy-Paste Quick Summary
- V4-05 closes the repo-side launch-readiness work, including presets and updated smoke contracts. It remains `shipped-not-complete` because production never advanced from `9addb96...` during the verification window.
