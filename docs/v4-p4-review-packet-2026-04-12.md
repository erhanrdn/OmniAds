# CODex Phase Review Packet

## 1. Identity
- Phase: `V4-04 — Meta↔Creative Deployment Graph & Opportunity Semantics`
- Date: `2026-04-12`
- Implementation commit: `8c38576d9e4aee831af36d8082f3250f8168c550`
- Baseline live SHA at review start: `9addb96bedfbaf5067584418c1c3e139543f92fd`

## 2. Scope Delivered
- Added reverse creative linkage to Meta campaigns and opportunity items.
- Standardized queue semantics across Meta and Creative: `queue_ready`, `board_only`, `protected`, `blocked`.
- Surfaced lane eligibility and blocked reasons in Creative review.
- Kept queue-ineligible items visible as context without presenting them as executable work.

## 3. Architecture Changes
- Shared linkage builder in [lib/meta/decision-os-linkage.ts](/Users/harmelek/Adsecute/lib/meta/decision-os-linkage.ts).
- Additive Meta linkage in [app/api/meta/decision-os/route.ts](/Users/harmelek/Adsecute/app/api/meta/decision-os/route.ts) and [lib/meta/decision-os.ts](/Users/harmelek/Adsecute/lib/meta/decision-os.ts).
- Queue/deployment semantics in [lib/creative-decision-os.ts](/Users/harmelek/Adsecute/lib/creative-decision-os.ts).
- Surface rendering in [components/meta/meta-decision-os.tsx](/Users/harmelek/Adsecute/components/meta/meta-decision-os.tsx) and [components/creatives/CreativesTableSection.tsx](/Users/harmelek/Adsecute/components/creatives/CreativesTableSection.tsx).

## 4. Acceptance Checklist
- Phase closure verdict: `shipped-not-complete`
- Real-account browser evidence captured: `no`
- Reason: live strong-account UI review was unavailable in this session.
- Benchmark evidence captured at deploy boundary: `no`
- Reason: benchmark linkage evidence was captured from local DB/runtime and the V4 candidate only; live did not advance to `8c38576...`.

## 5. Test Evidence
- `npx vitest run lib/command-center.test.ts lib/meta/decision-os.test.ts components/creatives/CreativeDecisionOsOverview.test.tsx`
- `npm test` -> `201 passed`
- `npm run test:smoke:local` -> `4 passed`, `1 skipped`
- Reviewer smoke now expects the queue filter label `Queue-ready`.

## 6. Live Smoke Evidence
- Grandmix verify-day: `manual_refresh_finalize_range` recommendation on `2026-04-11`.
- IwaStore verify-day: `none` refresh recommendation on `2026-04-06`, `finalized_verified`.
- TheSwaf verify-day: `manual_refresh_finalize_range` recommendation on `2026-04-08`.
- These benchmark states support V4 queue semantics: not every visible board item is queue-safe work.

## 7. Deployment And Rollout
- Linkage and queue semantics shipped in repo under `8c38576...`.
- Production remained on `9addb96...`, so no live V4 opportunity linkage proof could be captured in browser.
- Live reviewer smoke failure was consistent with the old Meta copy still being served on production.

## 8. Known Risks
- Live benchmark replay at the deployed V4 boundary is still missing.
- TheSwaf keeps mixed readiness across two provider accounts, which can still compress linkage clarity.
- Command Center execution carry-forward remains outside V4 scope and still accepted-gap territory.

## 9. Exact Review Request For GPT
- Review whether queue and board semantics remain visually and semantically distinct across Meta and Creative.
- Focus on any case where a protected or blocked item could still look like default queue work.

## 10. Copy-Paste Quick Summary
- V4-04 is implemented in code and verified locally. Meta now receives creative linkage and queue verdict context, but the production environment never moved off `9addb96...`, so deploy-boundary proof is still open.
