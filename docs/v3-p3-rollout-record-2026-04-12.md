# V3-P3 Rollout Record

Date: `2026-04-12`
Status: `local_only_pending_deploy`
Baseline live SHA: `fe243d32cf61cac68b68ebed7a2c1da0c8e9552c`

Scope:
- Added shared `sourceHealth` and `readReliability` metadata.
- Wired the metadata through Operating Mode, Meta Decision OS, Creative Decision OS, and Command Center authority surfaces.
- Kept degraded / fallback labeling explicit instead of silently collapsing to empty status.

Verification:
- `npx tsc --noEmit`
- `npx vitest run lib/meta/decision-os.test.ts components/meta/meta-decision-os.test.tsx components/creatives/CreativeDecisionOsOverview.test.tsx components/meta/meta-operating-mode-card.test.tsx lib/business-operating-mode.test.ts`
- `npm test`

Residual risk:
- Repeated-read determinism now reports explicit reliability labels, but no new production benchmark replay was run from this session.

Blockers:
- No deployed runtime was exercised after these changes.
